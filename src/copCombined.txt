separate scores, D-Score and E-Score.
b) The D-Panel establishes the D-Score, the content of an exercise, and
the E-Panel the E-Score, the execution and artistry.
c) The Final Score of an exercise will be established by the addition of the
D-Score and E-Score.
If necessary, subtraction of the neutral deductions (see 5.4.1).
d) The All Around Score is the sum of the Final Scores obtained from the
four apparatus.

SECTION 7 – Regulations Governing the
D-Score

7.2.1 Recognition of DV of elements
a) To reward DV an element must be performed according to the description
of the body position in the Table of Elements.
b) The same element will receive DV only one time in an exercise and in
chronological order.

7.1 D-Score (Content)
a) The D-Score on VT is the Difficulty Value in the Table of Vaults.

c) Arabian elements are considered Forward Elements

b) The D-Score on Uneven Bars, Balance Beam and Floor Exercise includes
the highest 8 difficulties, compositional requirements, connection value
and bonus.

d) Recognition of the Same and Different Elements

7.2 Difficulty Value (DV)

─ Different dance elements from the same box in the Table of Elements
(same number) will receive DV only one time in the exercise and in
chronological order.
─ Only one turn (pirouette) in tuck stand on one leg (BB & FX) will
receive DV, in chronological order.
─ The maximum number of turns recognised for:

The DV are elements from the Table of Elements in the Code of Points which
are open ended and may be expanded as needed.
a) The maximum 8 highest DV including the dismount are counted on UB,
BB and FX.

• passé pirouettes is 4/1 turn (1440°)
(Therefore 5/1 passé pirouette would be considered the same
element as 4/1)

b) The D-Panel will always recognise the DV of the element unless there is a
failure to meet the technical requirement of the element.

• all other pirouettes with a different leg position is 3/1 turn (1080°)
Difficulty Value
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

A = 0.10
B = 0.20
C = 0.30
D = 0.40
E = 0.50
F = 0.60
G = 0.70
H = 0.80
I = 0.90
J = 1.00

• Split/Straddle leaps and jumps (ie.
• Complex jumps and leaps (ie.

,

) is 1½ turn (540°)

) is 1/1 turn (360°)

e) Elements are considered different, if they are listed under different
numbers in the Table of Elements
f)

Elements are considered the same, if they are listed under the same
number and have the following criteria:
─ UB elements:
• are performed with or without a hop grip change
• giants fwd & bwd performed with legs straddled or together,
with hips bent or stretched
• pike sole circle fwd & bwd performed with legs straddled or
together
• legs are together or straddled in flight elements

Section 7 page - 1

─ Dance elements:
• with take off from one or two feet with the same leg position
─ Example: wolf hop (take off from one foot) and
wolf jump (take off from two feet)
• are performed in side or cross position (BB)
─ Jumps performed in side position will be awarded 1 DV higher
than in cross position
─ If the same element is performed in cross and in side position,
the DV will be awarded one time only and in chronological
order
─ Jumps that start from side position and finish in cross position,
or vice versa – consider as elements performed in cross
position (additional 90° does not make element different)
• land on one or both feet (BB)
• land on one or both feet or in prone position (FX)

─ Example: Split leap to ring without required arch it becomes split leap,
if the split leap to ring is performed later with correct technique it is
recognised as a split leap to ring because both elements appear in the
Table of Elements.
─ Example BB:
turn is credited as another element from the COP
due to failure to hold the free leg at horizontal from the beginning to
the end of the turn (360°). It is then performed a 2nd time in the
exercise correctly – Credit DV
c) If an element is credited one DV lower due to failure to meet technical
requirements and is later performed again in the exercise it will then be
considered as a repetition and no DV will be awarded.
─ Example UB: giant bwd with 1½ turn that is credited one DV lower
(C), due to failure to reach handstand prior to the turn (swing).
It is then performed a 2nd time in the exercise and completed
1½ turn in handstand then no DV (D) will be awarded.

─ Acro elements:
• that land on one or both feet
g) Elements are considered different, if they are listed under the same
number and have the following criteria:
─ Acro elements:
• there are different body positions (tuck, pike or stretched) in saltos
• there are different degrees of turns:
½, 1/1, 1½ (180°, 360°, 540°) etc.
• the support is performed on one or both arms or free
• the take-off from one or both feet
7.2.2 Recognition of elements occurs in chronological order

7.2.3 New element / vault / connection submission for all competitions:
Coaches are encouraged to submit new vaults and elements that have not yet
been performed and/or do not yet appear in the Table of Elements.
•

The new elements must be presented no later than the day and hour
stipulated in the Work Plan.

•

The request for evaluation must be accompanied with any technical drawings
and a mandatory video on a USB memory stick.

•

All values given at competitions are provisional until approved by the FIG TC.

•

New elements performed in the Olympic qualification competitions require
confirmation of provisional value by the TC President before evaluation for
the respective competition.

•

The evaluation at the competition will be communicated as soon as possible
in writing to the concerned federation and to the judges at the Judges’
Instruction or Briefing before the respective competition.

•

The decisions have validity only at that specific competition.

•

New elements will appear for the first time in the Code Update /
Newsletter only after they have been performed successfully by the
gymnast then submitted and confirmed by the TC.

a) In case of technical failure elements will be recognised as:
– another element in the Table of Elements or
– No DV or
– One DV lower
b) If an element is recognised as another element (from the Table of
Elements) due to failure to meet technical requirements and later the
element is performed with correct technique they both receive DV.

Section 7 page - 2

In order for a new element/vault to be named after a gymnast it must be:
•

Performed internationally for the first time at an official FIG Group 1, 2 or
3 competition (with or without an official FIG TD present).

•

C value or higher and performed for DV.

•

DV and name will only be confirmed following a TC analysis of the
performance.

•

If more than one gymnast at the same competition performs the same
new element, the element will be named after all gymnasts.

•

The federation of the gymnast has the responsibility to submit a video of
the proposed new element to the FIG TC President as soon as possible
after the competition. In addition, the competition TD must submit the
official video, original video and drawing submitted by the coach (if
available), and all details about the provisional evaluation given at the
competition, to the FIG TC President as soon as possible.

d) Devalued elements may be used for CV & Bonus.
e) In order to credit CV & Bonus, the element must be performed without a
fall, or according to specific rules stated for the respective apparatus.

7.4.1 Direct and Indirect Connections

7.3 Compositional Requirements (CR) 2.00

All connections must be Direct;
only on Floor can acrobatic connections be Indirect.
Direct Connections are those in which elements are performed without:
a)
b)
c)
d)
e)
f)

stop between elements
extra step between elements
foot touching Beam between elements
lack of balance between elements
obvious leg/hip extension on 1st element before take-off for 2nd element
additional/excessive arm swing

a) Only elements from the Table of Elements may fulfil CR.

Indirect Connections (only in acrobatic series on FX), are those in which
directly connected acrobatic elements with flight phase and hand support
(from Group 3, e.g. round-off, flic-flac, etc. as preparatory elements) are
performed between saltos.

b) One element may fulfil more than one CR;
however, an element may not be repeated to fulfil another CR.

The recognition of direct or indirect (FX) connections should be to the benefit
of the gymnast.

Composition Requirements are described in the respective Apparatus Sections.
A maximum of 2.00 is possible.

7.4 Connection Value (CV) & Bonus

The order of succession of elements within a connection can be freely chosen
on BB, FX and UB (unless there is a special requirement for CV recognition).

Connection Value is to be achieved through unique combinations of elements
on Uneven Bars, Balance Beam and Floor Exercise.

7.4.2

Repetition of elements for CV (SB on BB)

a) Elements used for CV do NOT necessarily have to be among the
8 counting DV. All elements must be from the Table of Elements.

a) Elements may not be repeated in another connection for CV.
Recognition occurs in chronological order.

b) Connection Value on UB, BB and FX is evaluated at:
+0.10
+0.20

b) Same elements on UB, acrobatic elements on BB and FX may be
performed twice within one connection.
Dance elements cannot be repeated.

c) Formulas for CV & Bonus are described in the respective Apparatus
Sections - Part 3: Sections 11, 12 and 13.

Examples:
UB – Tkatchev x 2 or
Stalder with 1/1 turn x 2

Section 7 page - 3

BB – flic-flac with 1/1 turn x 2

– the 2nd time as the 1st element to begin a new connection
– the 3rd time as the connection of 2 same saltos

Examples:

FX

d) With the direct connection of 3 or more elements, the repeated flight
element on UB, or salto on BB and FX must be directly connected.
CV will be rewarded for all connections.
Salto

Examples:

may be used:

– the 1st time as a connection of 2 same saltos
– the 2nd time as the 1st element to begin a new connection

Recognition of body positions in single & double saltos without LA turn
Pike salto becomes tuck

In order to recognise DV specific technical expectations are required.
All directives for angles of completion of elements and body positions are
approximate and meant to serve as a guideline.

9.1 ALL APPARATUS

Tuck salto becomes stretch

Body Positions

If in Pike salto
knee angle is
less than 135°

- Credit Tuck salto

D-Panel
Hip open (180°)



Stretch


Less than 90° hip angle in
salto & dance elements

A slight hollow in the chest or a slight
arched body position is acceptable

All body parts in alignment

9.1.2 Landing from Single Saltos with Twists

9.1.1 Element Recognition
Stretch
– The majority of the salto must be maintained in the stretched position in:
 Single saltos
 Double saltos on FX and UB DMT
 Vaults (saltos)
– When there is NO stretched position shown it is considered pike
position in:
 Non-twisting elements UB, BB and FX

a) Elements with twists performed
─ as mounts and dismounts from UB and BB
─ during the exercise on BB and FX
─ all landings on VT
must be completed exactly or another element from the COP will be
recognised.
Note: The placement of the front foot is decisive when awarding the DV.

– A slight bend in the hips (up to 30°) is allowed on Vaults without twists

b) For under turning*
– 3/1 twist becomes 2½ twist
– 2½ twist becomes 2/1 twist
– 2/1 twist becomes 1½ twist
– 1½ twist becomes 1/1 twist
*FX: When there is a salto with twist directly connected to another salto and in the
first salto the turn is not completed exactly (but the gymnast is able to continue
into the next element), the first element will NOT be devalued.

Section 9 page - 1

Under turning of more than 30° – another element from the COP will be
recognised.

9.1.3 Falls on Landing
a) with landing feet first
– the DV is awarded
b) without landing feet first – no DV is awarded

The position of the shoulders and hips are decisive.

9.2 BALANCE BEAM AND FLOOR EXERCISE

Example:

9.2.1 Rewarding DV for turns on 1 leg are in increments of:
– 180° for BB
– 360° for FX
– The turn must be completed exactly or another element from the COP
will be credited.
– The position of the shoulders and hips are decisive otherwise another
element from the COP will be credited.
Turn Considerations:
– Must be performed on the toes.
– Have a fixed and well defined shape throughout the turn.
– The support leg, whether straight or bent (choreography), does not
change the DV.
– For turns on 1 leg requiring the free leg to be at a specific position, the
position must be maintained throughout the turn.
– If the free leg is not in the prescribed position - credit another element
from the COP.

– 360° for FX
Various techniques of jumps, leaps and hops with 1/1 turn (360°) and more are
permitted; piking, tucking, straddling the legs may be at the beginning, in the
middle or at the end of the turn (unless there is a special requirement for the
element).

Insufficient Split:
> 0° - 20°
small fault
> 20° - 45° medium fault
> 45°
credit another element from the
COP or no DV

In jumps, leaps and hops with ½ turn (180°) the prescribed position must be
reached at the beginning OR at the end.

SECTIONS 10-13

10.2 Run Approaches

PART III APPARATUS

Additional run approaches are permitted as follows, with deduction of – 1.00 for
empty run (if gymnast has not touched the springboard or the apparatus).

SECTION 10 – Vault

−

When 1 vault is required, a second run approach is permitted with
deduction.

−

Third approach not permitted.

−

When 2 vaults are required, a third run approach is permitted with
deduction.

−

Fourth approach not permitted.

10.1 General
Depending on the requirements for the competition phase, the gymnast is
required to perform one or two vaults from the Table of Vaults.
Run distance is a maximum of 25 meters, measured from the front edge of the
table to the inner side of the block attached at the end of the vault run up mat.
−

The vault begins with a run, an arrival and take-off from the springboard
with two feet, from either a:
 forward position or
 backward position

The D-Panel will take the deduction from the Final Score of the vault performed.

10.3 Vault Groups

−

No vault with sideward landing may be submitted.

The vaults are classified into the following groups:

−

All vaults must be performed with repulsion from both hands off the
vaulting table.

Group 1 –

Vault without salto (Handspring, Yamashita, Round-off)
with or without LA turn in 1st and/or 2nd flight phase.

−

The gymnast is required to properly use the “safety collar” supplied by the
Organising Committee for round-off entry vaults.

Group 2 –

Handspring fwd with or without 1/1 turn (360°) in 1st flight phase
– salto fwd or bwd with or without twist in 2nd flight phase.

−

A hand placement mat may be used only for Yurchenko vaults from
groups 1, 4 and 5.

Group 3 –

Handspring with ¼ - ½ turn (90° - 180°) in 1st flight phase
(Tsukahara) – salto bwd with or without twist in 2nd flight phase.

−

All vaults are illustrated with a number.

Group 4 –

Round-off (Yurchenko) with or without ¾ turn (270°) in 1st flight
phase – salto bwd with or without twist in 2nd flight phase.

−

The gymnast is responsible for flashing the intended vault number prior to
the beginning of each vault (manually or electronically).

Group 5 –

Round-off with ½ turn (180°) in 1st flight phase – salto fwd or bwd
with or without twist in 2nd flight phase.

−

After receiving the green light or signal from the D1 Judge, the gymnast
executes the 1st vault and then returns to the end of the runway to post
the number for her 2nd vault.

−

Beginning with the take-off, the vault phases are evaluated:
 pre-flight (1st flight)
 repulsion
 flight (2nd flight) and landing
Section 10 page - 1

10.4 Requirements
–

The intended vault number to be flashed (manually or electronically)
before the vault is performed.

−

In the Qualifying, Team Final and All-Around:
One vault must be performed.



–

10.4.1 Corridor Markings

In Qualifying, the 1st vault score counts toward the Team and/or
All-Around Total.
The gymnast who wishes to qualify for the Apparatus Final must
perform 2 vaults as per the Apparatus Finals rules below.

Apparatus Finals




The gymnast must perform 2 vaults, which will be averaged for the
Final Score.
The 2 vaults must be from different Vault Groups.
Must show a different 2nd flight phase.

Example:
1. If the 1st vault is from Gr. 4
Round-off, flic-flac on – stretched salto backward
with 2½ twist (900°) off
then the choices for the 2nd vault would be:
 Tsukahara stretched with 2/1 twist (720°) off
or
 Handspring fwd on – 1/1 turn off

Note: Handspring fwd on – tucked double salto fwd off:
If the 2nd salto is not completed because the gymnast lands on the feet
and any other body part simultaneously, then the vault will be
recognised as Handspring fwd on – tucked fwd salto off

As an orientation for directional deductions there will be a marked corridor on
the landing mat. The gymnast must land and finish to a stable stand in this
zone.
The D1 Judge (with written notification from the Line Judge) will deduct from the
Final Score for touching the mat with any part of the body outside of the marked
corridor as follows:
−
−

Land or step outside with one foot/hand (part of foot/hand)
Land or step outside with two feet/hands
(part of feet/hands) or body part

– 0.10
– 0.30

10.4.2 Specific Apparatus Deductions – D-Panel
Taken from the Final Score of the vault performed:
–
–
–

More than 25 meters run distance
Run approach without performing vault
Support (repulsion phase) with only one hand

–

In the Qualification to and in Apparatus Finals:
 When 1 of 2 vaults receives “0” points (10.4.3)

− 0.50
− 1.00
− 2.00

Evaluation:
Score of the vault performed divided by 2 = Final Score (FS)

2. If the 1st vault is from Gr. 2
Handspring fwd on – tucked salto fwd off
then the choices for the 2nd vault would be:

 When the 2 vaults are not from different groups or
do not show a different second flight phase

 Round off, flic-flac on – stretched salto bwd off
or

Evaluation:
[(FS of the 1st Vault) + (FS of the 2nd Vault, minus 2.00)]/2 = Final Score

 Tsukahara piked

Section 10 page - 2

10.4.3 Performance of Invalid Vaults (0.00 P.) *

10.6 Specific Apparatus Deductions – E-Panel

−

The vault is executed without a support phase, i.e. neither hand touches
the table.

−

Failure to properly use the safety collar for round-off entry vaults.

−

Spotting assistance during the vault.

−

Failure to land on feet first.

−

The vault is so poorly executed that the intended vault cannot be
recognised, or the gymnast pushes from the table with her feet.

−

(straddled legs, prohibited pre-element before the vaulting board,
intentionally lands in side position).

−

The first vault is repeated for the second vault in Qualification for Vault
Final or in Vault Final.

*Note: “0.00” score recorded by D-Panel. No evaluation by E-Panel.
A video review by the D-Panel and Apparatus Supervisor will automatically
occur for every vault that receives an Invalid 0.00 Score, or vaults performed
with support of one hand only.

10.5 Method of Scoring
D-Panel:
Enters the value of the performed vault and shows on the board to the
E-Judges the symbol of the vault recognised (if different from flashed number).
The score of the 1st vault must be flashed before the gymnast executes the 2nd
vault.
E-Panel:
Execution Deductions (Section 8) must be taken in addition to
Specific Apparatus Deductions.

11.2 Content and Construction of the Exercise
The maximum 8 highest difficulties including the dismount are counted for DV.

11.1 General
The evaluation of the exercise begins with the take-off from the springboard
or the mat. Additional supports under the springboard (i.e. an extra board)
are not permitted.

–
–

a) Mounts
– If the gymnast on her first attempt touched the springboard,
the apparatus, or ran underneath the apparatus:
 Deduction
– 1.00
 She must start her exercise
 No value will be awarded for the mount
– A gymnast is permitted a second attempt to mount (with a penalty)
if she has NOT touched the springboard, the apparatus,
or run underneath the apparatus:
 Deduction
– 1.00
– A third attempt is not permitted.

* The root skill is determined by the entry into the skill and the direction
of the rotation (bwd or fwd)

Elements with no DV (due to failure to meet the technical requirement)
will not be counted in the root skill number.

Only one “Tkatchev” type element without turn from each line in the Table of
Elements will be recognised.

The timing starts when the gymnast is on her feet after the fall.
The elapsed time during the fall will be displayed in seconds on
the scoreboard.
– A warning signal (gong) will be communicated at:
 10 seconds
 20 seconds and again at the
 30 second time limit
– The exercise officially resumes when the feet leave the floor.
– If the gymnast has not resumed the exercise within the 60 second
time limit, the exercise will be terminated.

Example 2:

Gymnast may NOT run/walk under low bar to perform mount (see 2.4).

b) Fall Timing
For interruption of the exercise due to a fall from the apparatus an
intermediate time period of 30 seconds is allowed.

No DMT – 0.50 from Final Score (D-Panel).
Only 3 elements in chronological order from the same root skill* will be
counted for DV, CR and CV

Artistic Performance

SECTION 12 – Balance Beam
ARTISTRY

When a gymnast demonstrates creativity, confidence of performance,
personal style, perfect technique and varied rhythm and tempo, she
transforms a well-structured composition into an artistic performance.

Composition

This is not “what” the gymnast performs, but “how” she performs.

The composition of a Balance Beam exercise is based on the movement
vocabulary of the gymnast, as well as the choreography of these elements in
relationship to the Balance Beam, while establishing a strong sense of variation
in rhythm, strength and pace of the movements. It is the balancing of:

12.1 General

 dance elements
 acro elements
 choreography
in order to create a continuous flow, a cohesive whole.
A well-structured composition of the exercise includes:






a rich and varied selection of elements from different structure groups
in the Table of Elements
changes of level (up and down)
changes of direction (fwd, bwd, swd)
changes of rhythm & tempo
creative movements and transitions

The evaluation of the exercise begins with the take-off from the board or the
mat. Additional supports under the board (i.e. an extra board) are not
permitted.
a) Mounts
– If the gymnast on her first attempt touched the springboard, or the
apparatus.
 Deduction
– 1.00
 She must start her exercise
 No value will be awarded for the mount
 Deduction for “Mount without DV” will be applied (E-Panel)
– A gymnast is permitted a 2nd attempt to mount (with a penalty) if she
has not touched the springboard or the apparatus.
 Deduction
– 1.00

This is “what” she performs.

– A 3rd attempt is not permitted.

Rhythm & Tempo
The rhythm and tempo (speed/pace) must be varied, sometimes lively,
sometimes slow, but predominately dynamic and above all uninterrupted.

D-Panel will take the deduction from the Final Score.
b) Timing

The transition between the movements and elements should be smooth and
fluent:



without unnecessary stops or
prolonged preparatory movements before elements

The duration of the exercise on the Balance Beam may not exceed 1:30
minutes (90 seconds).
– The Time Judge 1 begins timing when the gymnast takes-off from
the springboard or mat. She stops the clock, when the gymnast
touches the mat upon completion of her Beam exercise.

The exercise should not be a series of disconnected elements.

Section 12 page - 1

– If the gymnast has not resumed within 60 seconds, the exercise will
be terminated.

– A signal (gong) will be communicated ten (10) seconds prior to the
maximum time limit and again at the maximum time limit (1:30) to
indicate that the exercise is to be finished.

– No salute is necessary to resume an exercise after a fall.
– If the dismount lands at the sound of the second signal, there is no
deduction.

– After remounting the Beam the resumption of timing by Time Judge 1
begins with the first movement to continue the exercise.

– If the dismount lands after the sound of the second signal, there is a
deduction for exceeding the time limit.
– The deduction for overtime will be taken, if the exercise is 1:31
minutes (91 seconds) or more.
 – 0.10
– Elements performed after the 90 second time limit will be
recognised by the D-Panel and evaluated by the E-Panel.
– Time violations are reported in writing by the respective Time Judge
to the D-Panel Judges, who then take the deduction from the Final
Score.

12.2 Content of the Exercise
The maximum 8 highest difficulties including the dismount are counted for DV.
- No DMT – 0.50 from Final Score (D-Panel)
Within the 8 counting elements there must be a minimum of:
 3 Dance
 3 Acro
and 2 optional elements

12.3 Composition Requirements (CR) – D-Panel 2.00 P.
c) Fall Timing:
For interruption of the exercise due to a fall from the apparatus, an
intermediate time period of 10 seconds is allowed.
– If the gymnast exceeds the allowable time to resume her exercise
a – 0.30 neutral deduction for excessive time will be applied if the
gymnast continues her exercise.
– Time Judge 2 begins timing when the gymnast is on her feet after
the fall.

1. One connection of at least 2 different dance elements,
1 being a leap or jump with
180° split (cross or side), or straddle position
2. Turn (Gr. 3) or Roll/Flairs*
3. One Acro series, min. of 2 flight** elements
1 being a salto (elements may be the same)
4. Acro elements in different directions (fwd/swd and bwd)
*
**

– The duration of the fall is timed separately; it will not be calculated
in the total time of the exercise.
– The elapsed time during the fall will be displayed in seconds on the
scoreboard.

– CR 1, 2 (turn), 3 & 4 must be performed on the Beam
– Handstands and holds may not be used to fulfill CR
– Rolls can be used only to fulfill CR # 2

– A signal (gong) will be communicated at the 10 second time limit.

Expression

SECTION 13 — Floor Exercise
ARTISTRY
Artistic Performance
An artistic performance is one in which the gymnast demonstrates her ability to
transform her Floor exercise from a well-structured composition into an artistic
performance. In so doing the gymnast must demonstrate a strong
choreographic flow, artistry, expressiveness, musicality and perfect technique.
The main objective is to create and present a unique and well-balanced artistic
gymnastic composition by combining the body movements and expression of
the gymnast harmoniously with the theme and character of the music.

Expression can be defined generally as the attitude and range of emotion
exhibited by the gymnast with both her face and through her body. This
includes how a gymnast generally presents herself and connects with the
judges and the audience, as well as her ability to control/manage her
expression during the performance of the most difficult and complex
movements. It is also her ability to play a role or a character throughout the
performance. In addition to the technical execution, artistic harmony and
feminine grace must also be considered.
It is not only “what” the gymnast performs, but also “how” she performs her
exercise.
Music

Composition and Choreography

The music must be flawless, without any abrupt cuts, and must contribute a
sense of unity to the overall composition and performance of the exercise.

The composition of a Floor exercise is based on the movement vocabulary of
the gymnast, as well as the choreography of those elements and movements,
that is, the mapping out of the body's movements, both gymnastic and artistic,
over space and time in relationship to the floor area and in harmony with the
selected music.

It should flow and must have a clear start and clear finish. The chosen music
must also help to highlight the unique characteristics and style of the gymnast.
The character of the music should provide the guiding idea/theme of the
composition.


The choreography should be developed such that one movement flows
smoothly into the next with contrasts in the speed and intensity.
Creative choreography, that is the originality of the composition of elements
and movements, means that the exercise has been constructed and is
performed using new ideas, forms, interpretations and originality, thereby
avoiding copying and monotony.
The design, structure and composition of the exercise includes:





a rich and varied selection of elements from different structure groups in
the Table of Elements
changes of level (up and down)
changes of direction (fwd, bwd, swd and curves)
creative or original movements, connections and transitions into acro
lines

There must be a direct correlation between the movements and the
music. The accompaniment should be personalised to the gymnast and
must contribute to the overall artistry and perfection of her performance.

Musicality
Musicality is the ability of the gymnast to interpret the music and to
demonstrate not only its rhythm and speed, but its flow, shape, intensity and
passion.
The music must support the performance and, through her movements, the
gymnast must convey the theme of the music to the judges and the audience.

This is “what” the gymnast performs.
Section 13 page - 1

c) Border Markings

13.1 General

Exceeding the prescribed floor area (12 x 12 m), that is touching the
floor with any part of the body outside of the border markings, will result
in a deduction:

a) Music Requirements
– The Floor exercise music will be given to the competition
administration. Each piece of music will be timed; said time will be
approved by the administration and the delegation head coach.
– The following must be included:
 The name of the gymnast and the 3 capitalised letters used by
FIG for the country code.
 The name of the composer and the title of the music.
– The musical accompaniment with orchestration, piano or other
instruments must be recorded.
 A signal or tone may be used at the beginning of the recording.
However, the name of the gymnast may not be spoken.
 The human voice may be used as a musical instrument without
words:
o Examples of the ‘human voice’ as an acceptable
instrument are: humming, vocalising without words,
whistling, chanting.
o Any music which is not clearly a song or part of a song
is accepted.
 Absence of music or music with words – 1.00
Note: Taken by the D-Panel from the Final Score.
In case of doubt, the federation/gymnast may submit music to the
WTC for evaluation.

– One step or landing outside of the boundary
with a foot or hand
– Step(s) outside with both feet, both hands or a
body part or landing with both feet outside

– 0.10

Both time and line violations are reported in writing by the respective Time and
Line Judge to the D-Panel, who then take the deduction from the Final Score.

13.2 Content of the Exercise
The maximum 8 highest difficulties including the dismount are counted for DV.
– No DMT – 0.50 from Final Score (D-Panel).
Within the 8 counting elements there must be a minimum of:
 3 Dance
 3 Acro
and 2 optional elements
The dismount is the last counting acro line (credit highest DV)
 No DMT will be credited if only one acro line is performed.
a) Acro Lines

b) Timing
The evaluation of the exercise begins with the first movement of the
gymnast. The duration of the exercise may not exceed 1:30 minutes
(90 seconds).
– The Time Judge begins timing when the gymnast begins with the
first movement of her exercise.
– The Time Judge stops timing when the gymnast ends her exercise
with the last position. The exercise must end with the music.
– The deduction for overtime will be taken if the exercise is
1:31 minutes (91 seconds) or more
– 0.10.
– Elements performed after the 90 second time limit will be recognised
by the D-Panel and evaluated by the E-Panel.

Section 13 page - 2

– The maximum number of acro lines is 4.
– Any difficulty in additional acro line(s) will not be counted for DV.
– Any acro element performed after the last counting acro line will not
be counted for DV.
– An acro line consists of a minimum of 2 directly connected flight
elements one of which must be a salto.
 Failure to land on the feet first from a salto will still be
considered an acro line.

NOTE: For logical reasons, the sequence is not in Olympic order.
The presentation begins with the basic symbols for all apparatus – hangs, supports, handstands,
leaps-jumps-hops, leg and body positions and turns around the breadth, long and median axes.
Apparatus specific symbols and element groups for Uneven Bars are treated separately; however,
Beam and Floor specific symbols, common dance and acrobatic elements are handled in the same
section. Vault specific symbols and examples for vaults in each of the groups are featured in the last
section.
Through a combination of the basic symbols and specific symbols, practically all elements can be
recorded, even those that are submitted and performed for the first time.

PREFACE

The History of the Development of Symbol Notation
In 1979, for the first time, the FIG Women's Technical Committee published symbols for Women's
Artistic Gymnastics for the principle elements.
During the time period from 1980 through 1986, the symbol notation underwent extensive practical
testing, with a goal toward perfection in keeping with the evolution of gymnastics. All exercises
executed in official FIG Competitions (Olympic Games, World Championships, World Cups and
the Senior and Junior European Championships under the jurisdiction of FIG) were recorded in
symbol notation by the Scientific Technical Collaborators (STCs), then checked by means of video
analysis. Thus, a systematic analysis was developed. Through use of the recorded exercise content,
the WTC was able to monitor the developmental tendencies and their resulting indications for
continual improvements in the WAG Code of Points.
In 1985 a supplement was published and in July 1986 the first symbol publication entitled "Proposal
for the Introduction of an International Symbols Language for Women's Artistic Gymnastics" was
published. Then, in 1990/91 the FIG issued a Video Film and Brochure for learning and practicing
the Symbol Notation in WAG. The Video, as well as the accompanying Brochure, was prepared by
Ms. Margot Dietz – GER, who was entrusted with this task by the governing President of the
FIG/WTC, Mrs. Ellen Berger. Based on the realisation of this sophisticated development of the
symbol system, the appropriate symbol for each element and its variation appeared in the 1993
edition of the Code of Points for the first time.
Since 1999 the Symbol Notation Brochure has been updated and formatted with computer symbols
by Mrs. Linda Chencinski to reflect the development of new skills.
With the constant progressive and exciting development of new elements in WAG, the WTC is
pleased to publish the 2021 update to the Symbol Notation Brochure, with the objective to provide a
uniform official revision for judges throughout the world of gymnastics. The WTC hopes that this
updated brochure will assist judges in:
• accurately recording all elements performed
• quickly establishing the content of the exercise
• communicating with fellow judges from the various language groups and
• most importantly, to recall dynamic and modern exercises in their entirety during competitions.

PART II
Evaluation of exercises

Section 6
The Evaluation of Competition Exercises

Article 6.1 General Rules
1.	Two separates scores, “D” and “E”, will be calculated on all apparatus.
-	 The D-jury determine the “D” score, the content of an exercise,
and the E-jury the “E” score, i.e. the exercise presentation
related to compositional requirements, technique and body
position.
-	 “D” score content will include by addition:
-	 The additional difficulty value of 10 elements (8 for
juniors), the best 9 (7 for juniors), but maximum 5 elements for the same Element Group, inside the best
counting plus the value of the dismount. If the judge
needs to choose the counting 9 (7 for juniors) elements
from elements which have the same value but belong to
different Element Groups, he must determine them to the
benefit of the gymnast. Once the 9 (7 for juniors) best
counting elements plus the dismount of the exercise are
determined, the judge must count among them not more
than 5 elements from the same element group (for FX,
the Element Group of the dismount will count first).


Example 1:

I	 III	 I	 II	 III	III	III	III	 I	 II	 IV

A	B	B	B	B	B	B	C	C	C	 D

	 B	B	B	B	B	B	C	C	C	 D

Example 2:

B	 B	B	B	B	B	B	D	D	D	D	 D
B		 B	B	B	B		 D	D	D	D	 D

In bold letters counting elements.

III	III	 I	 II	 II	 II	 III	III	III	III	IV	 IV

connections value, based on special rules on different
apparatus.
-	 Element Group Requirements Value, performed among
the 10 counting elements (8 for juniors).
-	 “E” score, will start from 10 points and will evaluate by deductions applied in tenths of a point:
-	 The total deductions for aesthetic and execution errors.
-	 The total deductions for technical and compositional errors.
-	 The highest and the lowest sums of total deductions applied
in tenths of a point for execution, aesthetic, technical and
compositional errors are eliminated. The average remaining

sums is subtracted from the 10 points in order to determine
the Final “E” Score.

Article 6.2 - Determination of the Final Score
1. The Final Score of an exercise will be established by the addition
of the “D” and final “E” scores.
2.	The rules governing the evaluation of the exercises and the determination of the Final Score are identical for all sessions of optional
competition (Qualification, Team Final, All Around Final, Apparatus
Finals) except for Vault, where special rules in Qualification and in
Apparatus Finals apply (see Section 13).
3.	The All-Around Score is the sum of the Final Scores obtained on
the six exercises.
4.	The Team Score is calculated in accordance with the current
Technical Regulations that govern that competition.
5.	Qualification for, and participation in, the Team Final, the All Around
Final, and the Apparatus Finals will occur in accordance with the
current Technical Regulations that govern that competition.
6.	The Final Score is normally calculated by the competition scoring
personnel but must be confirmed by the Apparatus Supervisor
before it is displayed.
7.	At official FIG competitions, the single “D” score from the D-jury
and the “E” score (the average of exercise presentation deductions
subtracted from 10 from each judge of the E-jury) will be displayed.
Each individual score of the E-jury will appear on the main results
form. At all other competitions, the “D” score, “E” score and the
Final Score must be displayed.

Article 6.3 - Short exercise
For exercise presentation, the gymnast may earn a maximum
E- Score of 10.00 points.
The D -Panel will take the appropriate neutral deduction (penalty)
for a short exercise from the Final Score.

Section 7
Regulations Governing the D score (DV)

Article 7.1 Difficulty
1.	On Floor Exercise, Pommel Horse, Rings, Parallel Bars, and
Horizontal Bar, the following difficulty values will count in all competitions:

Values	 A	 B	 C	D	 E	 F	 G	H
parts
Value	 0.10	0.20	0.30	0.40	 0.50	 0.60	0.70	0.80

2.	To the extent possible, only single elements are included in the
Difficulty Tables. Each element is given a unique difficulty value
and a unique Code Identification Number.
3.	Elements that are not listed in the Difficulty Tables must be submitted for a difficulty rating to the Chair of the Superior Jury 24
hours in advance of podium training at official FIG Competitions.
Provisional difficulty ratings may be given by Technical Authorities
at other international, national, and local competitions.
5.	Elements that no longer appear in the Code are usually not permitted or fall below the value of an A.
6.	Elements in same box with different values may be performed in
the same exercise with both elements contributing to the “D” Score.

Article 7.2 Element Group and Dismount Requirements
1.	With this evaluation category, the judge evaluates those required
movement patterns which, in addition to the gymnast’s personal
inclinations and technical abilities, are intended to enhance the
variety of movement in the construction of an exercise.
2.	Each apparatus has three Element Groups designated as I, II, III,
and, except for Floor Exercise, a Dismount Group designated as
IV.
3.	In his exercise, the gymnast must include at least one element
from each of the three Element Groups.
4.	An element may meet the Element Group requirement only for the
Element Group under which it is located in the Difficulty Tables.
5.	Each Element Group requirement fulfillment (inside the 10 counting
elements) is awarded with 0.5 points by the D-jury.
6.	Every exercise must end with a legitimate dismount listed under
the Dismount Element Group. (see Section 10 and 13 for specific
regulations for Floor Exercise and Vault). Non-legitimate dismounts
include:
i.	 A dismount that pushes off the feet (except on Floor Exercise).
ii.	An exercise finished with a partially shown or incomplete
dismount.
iii.	A dismount that does not land on the feet (including rollout
elements on Floor Exercise).
iv.	A dismount that intentionally lands sideways.
NB. Such elements always lead to non-recognition by the D-jury
of the element and the Element Group.
4.	An element (or element with the same Code Identification Number)
may be repeated but such repeated element may not contribute
towards the “D” score. See additional regulations restricting repetition for Pommel Horse and Rings in Section 11 and 12.

7.	Regarding Dismount element group requirements, the following
rule will be applied:
- A or B value dismount 	 0.00 p. (does not fulfill requirement).
- C value dismount
+0.30 p. (partial requirement value).
- D or higher value
+0.50 p. (full requirement value).
For juniors:
- A value dismount
0.00 p. (does not fulfill requirement).
- B value dismount
+0.30 p. (partial requirement value).
- C or higher value
+0.50 p. (full requirement value).

Article 7.3 Connection Points
1.	This evaluation factor provides the D-jury with the possibility of
awarding special connections. Thereby, these Connection Points
serve to better differentiate the exercises which contain special
connections between elements, as particularly described on each
apparatus.
2.	Connection Points may be awarded only for directly connected
recognized high valued elements performed without a large error.

Article 7.4 Evaluation by the D-jury
1. The D-jury is responsible for evaluating the content of the exercise and determining the correct “D” score on each apparatus as
defined in Sections 10 to 15. Except in the circumstances defined
in Article 7.4 the D-jury is obligated to recognize and credit each
legal element that is correctly performed.
2.	The gymnast is expected to include in his exercise only elements
that he can perform with complete safety and with a high degree of
aesthetic and technical mastery. Very poorly performed elements
will not be recognized by the D-jury and will be deducted by the
E-jury.
3.	Each element is defined to the perfect end position or as being
performed with perfection.
4.	An element that is not recognized by the D-jury will receive no
value.
5.	An element will not be recognized by the D-jury if it deviates significantly from the prescribed execution. An element will not be
recognized or credited for reasons including, but not necessarily
restricted to, the following:
a)	If, on Floor Exercise, the element is performed beginning
outside of the floor area (see Section 10 Art. 10.2.1.3a).
b)	 If, on Vault, the gymnast performs an invalid Vault as defined
in Section 13.
c)	 If on Horizontal Bar, an element is performed with or from feet
on the bar (see Section 15).
d)	 If a hold element with straddled legs not listed in the difficulty
tables is performed on any apparatus.
e)	 If the element is so altered in performance that it can no longer
lay any claim to its identification number or value (see also
Appendix A.3.1), for example:
i.	 A strength element performed almost entirely with swing.
ii.	 A swing element performed almost entirely with strength.
iii.	A stretched position element performed with a distinct
tuck or pike or vice versa. In such cases an element is
normally given the value of the element as performed.
iv.	 A strength element normally performed with legs together
is performed with legs straddled.
v.	 A strength hold element performed with significantly bent
arms.
vi.	 An element in or to handstand on Rings that is controlled
with the legs or feet against the cables.
f)	 If the element has been completed with the assistance of a
spotter.
g)	If the gymnast falls on or from the apparatus during an element,
or alters, or interrupts it in some other manner.
h)	If the gymnast falls on or from the apparatus during an element
without having reached an end position that permits continuation with at least a swing.
i)	 If a strength hold element or a simple hold element is not held.
j)	 If a press or pull out comes from a strength hold element which
has not been recognized or credited for any reason.
k)	If a twisting element on most apparatus is performed with
an over- or under-rotation of 90° or greater or if a swinging
element is performed with a deviation from the perfect end
position of 45° or greater (see also Appendix A.3.1). In some
circumstances, especially on Vault, an over- or under-rotation
of 90° may result in the recognition of different value for the
vault by the D-jury.
l)	If, on Pommel Horse, elements in cross support or in side
support deviate from the correct support orientation by 45° or
greater for the greater portion of the element.
m) If strength hold positions or simple hold positions on any apparatus deviate from the correct horizontal body, arm, or leg
position by 45° or greater. This means, for example:
i.	 Inverted cross with the head of the gymnast entirely above
the circle of the rings. (This is usually >45°).
ii.	 Cross with the arm pits entirely above the circle of the
rings. (This is usually >45°).
iii.	 (see also Article 9.2.8).
6.	In all cases, the D-jury is to make decisions based on gymnastics
sense and to decide in the interests of the sport of gymnastics. In
cases of doubt, the benefit of that doubt must be given to the gymnast.
7.	Elements performed so poorly that they are not recognized by the
D-jury will normally be severely deducted by the E-jury as well.
8.	The elements with the highest difficulty values will be counted first
in cases of Special Repetition.
9.	For recognition of difficulty on Pommel Horse and Floor Exercise,
the dismount is always counted first.

Article 7.5 Repetition
1.	An exercise may not be repeated unless the gymnast has to interrupt his exercise for reasons outside of his control.
2.	If the gymnast falls on or from the apparatus, he may choose to
continue with his exercise from the fall or to repeat the missed
element for credit and continue from there. (See Article 9.2.5).
3.	No element (same Code Identification Number) may be repeated
for difficulty credit or for Connection Points. This applies also to
elements repeated in connections (exceptions: certain Pommel
Horse elements and circles that increase in value if performed
twice in special combinations, and Rings - see Section 11 and 12).
4.	If the difficulty of an element is not recognized for any reason, then
that element can also not meet an Element Group Requirement.

Section 8
Regulations Governing E score

Article 8.1 Description of Exercise Presentation
1.	The Exercise Presentation consists of only those factors that constitute the essence of a contemporary gymnastics performance and
the absence of which results in deductions by the E-jury. These
factors are:
a)	The technical, compositional (general expectations for exercise
construction) aesthetic and execution.
2.	The Exercise Presentation has a maximum value of 10.0 points.

Article 8.2 Calculation of E-jury deductions
1.	The judges of the E-jury, will judge an exercise and determine
the deductions independently and do so within 20 seconds of the
completion of the exercise.
2.	Each performance is evaluated with reference to expectations
of perfect performance. All deviations from this expectation are
deducted.
a)	Deductions for errors in aesthetic and execution, technique
and composition are summed to a maximum of 10.0 points
for Exercise Presentation.

Article 8.3 Instructions for the Gymnast
1.	The gymnast must include in his exercise only elements that he
can perform with complete safety and with a high degree of aesthetic and technical mastery. The responsibility for his safety rests
entirely with him. The E jury is required to deduct very rigorously
for any aesthetic, execution, composition and technical errors.
2.	The gymnast must never attempt to increase the difficulty or the
“D” score at the expense of aesthetic and technical execution.
3.	All mounts must commence from the basic stand position, from
a short run (only Parallel Bars and Horizontal Bar), or from a still
hang. Pre-elements or intermediate elements may not precede
the mount. This rule does not apply to Vault where the specific
rules stated for that apparatus apply.
4.	Dismounts from all apparatus as well as the conclusion on Floor
Exercise and Vault must end in a standing position with the legs
together. With the exception of Floor Exercise, pushing from the
apparatus with the feet in order to execute the dismount is not
permitted.

Section 9
Technical Directives

Article 9.1 Evaluation by the E - jury
1.	The E-Jury is responsible for evaluating all of the aesthetic,
execution and technical performance aspects of an exercise as
well as its compliance with the composition (exercise construction
expectations) for that apparatus. In each case the E -Jury is to
demand that elements be performed with perfection and to perfect
end positions (see also Appendix A.2).
2.	The gymnast is expected to include in his exercise only elements
that he can perform with complete safety and with a high degree of
aesthetic and technical mastery. All deviations from that expectation will be deducted rigorously by the E-jury.
3.	The E-jury is not to concern at all with the difficulty of an exercise.
He is obligated to deduct equally severely for any error of the
same magnitude regardless of the difficulty of the element or the
connection.
4.	Judges of the E-Jury (and the D-jury) must remain up-to-date with
contemporary gymnastics, must know at all times what the most
contemporary performance expectation for an element should be,
and must know how standards are changing as the sport evolves.
In this context they must also know what is possible, what is
reasonable to expect, what is an exception, and what is a special
effect (see also Appendix A.3).
5.	The E-Jury must understand to refrain from deducting when some
elements, which otherwise have no errors, are performed for a
special effect or a special purpose. For example:
i.	 On Parallel Bars, a basket or a giant swing deliberately performed with flight and travel, and with a late re-grasp has a
special effect and purpose and should not be deducted for not
ending in handstand. However the onus is on the gymnast to
show the effect or purpose in an unmistakable and conspicuous manner.
ii.	On Horizontal Bar, a giant swing is often modified in preparation for release elements and dismounts. These should not be
deducted for not passing through a handstand unless they are
unnecessary or so extreme as to violate aesthetic, execution
and technical expectations.
6.	If for any reason a judge of the E-Jury cannot reach a decision,
he must give the benefit of the doubt to the gymnast.
7.	The E-jury is obligated to deduct twice for two distinctly different
errors in an element, i.e. if the element has both a technical and
an aesthetic execution error. For example a stützkehre on Parallel
Bars may receive both deductions for insufficient amplitude and
for bent knees.

Article 9.2 Determination of Execution and Technical Errors

1.	Each element is defined to the perfect end position or as being
performed with perfection. (See also Part IV).
2.	All deviations from correct performance are considered execution or technical errors and must be evaluated accordingly by the
judges. The amount of the deduction for small, medium, or large
errors is determined by the degree of deviation from the correct
performance. The same deduction is applied each time for the
same severity of bending, whether it be the arms, legs, or the body.
3.	The following deductions will apply for each and every discernible aesthetic or technical deviation from the expected perfect
performance. These deductions must be taken regardless of the
difficulty of the element or exercise.
Small Error
Medium Error
Large Error
Fall

0.1 p.
0.3 p.
0.5 p.
1.0 p.

a)	Small errors: (deduction = 0.1)
i.	 Any minor or slight deviation from the perfect end position
and from perfect technical execution.
ii.	 Any minor adjustments to hand, foot, or body position.
iii.	 Any other minor violations against aesthetic and technical
performance expectations.
b)	Medium errors: (deduction = 0.3)
i.	 Any distinct or significant deviation from the perfect end
position and from perfect technical execution.
ii.	 Any distinct or significant adjustments to hand, foot, or
body position.
iii.	 Any other distinct or significant violation against aesthetic
and technical performance expectations.
c)	Large errors: (deduction = 0.5)
i.	 Any major or severe deviation from the perfect end position and from perfect technical execution.
ii.	 Any major or severe adjustments to hand, foot, or body
position.
iii. Any full intermediate swing.
iv.	Any other major or severe violations against aesthetic
and technical performance expectations.
d)	Falls and spotter assistance: (deduction = 1.0 p.)
i.	 Any fall on or from the apparatus during an element
without having reached an end position that permits continuation with at least a swing (i.e. a distinct hang phase
on Horizontal Bar or a distinct support phase on Pommel
Horse after the element in question) or that otherwise
fails to display a momentary control of the element during
landing or re-grasp.
ii.	 -1.0 is the maximum deduction for an element with a fall,
and including all steps, touches, or support on the floor
or mat leading up to the fall. Other execution deductions
incurred for the element (height, landing extension, insufficient twist) still apply.
iii.	 Any assistance by a spotter that contributes to the completion of an element.
4.	On all apparatus at the end of the exercise, if a gymnast does not
perform a dismount, but lands intentionally on the feet, no deduction for a fall will be considered.
5.	After a fall on or from the apparatus, the exercise may be continued
within 30 seconds and the gymnast may use a necessary number
of elements or movements to return to his starting position but all
of these elements and movements must be performed with perfect
execution. He is permitted to repeat the missed element for credit,
except if the fall occurred during a dismount (except Pommel
Horse) or a Vault.
6.	Execution errors such as bent knees, bent arms, bad posture or
body position, poor rhythm, poor amplitude, etc. are listed in Articles
9.2 and 9.3 and are always deducted according to the degree of
error or deviation from what is considered perfect performance.

7.	Execution errors such as bending the arms, legs or body are
categorized as follows:
Small Error:
Medium Error:
Large Error:

slight bending.
strong bending.
extreme bending.

Medium error	 Large error	 Non-recognition D-jury

	 up to 15°
16° - 30°
		Examples:

> 30°

> 45°

a)	Deviations in hold positions of 30° and greater will receive a
large deduction from the E-jury. In addition, deviations of 45°
and greater will lead to the non recognition of the element by
the D-jury.
9.	A press from a static strength element that did not have its difficulty recognized for any reason will also not have its difficulty
recognized.
10. If the preceding strength hold element has received a deduction
for incorrect position, then the same deduction up to a maximum
of 0.30 points applies again to a press from that strength hold element if it is determined that the press has been simplified thereby.
This interpretation is intended only for circumstances where a high
position or a technically poor hold makes the subsequent press
easier (i.e. not for presses from faulty L sits, false grips, or for
time of hold positions). This deduction only applies to a high angle
deduction being applied to both elements connected by strength..
11. Technical deductions for angular deviation from the perfect end
position can also apply to swinging skills. In most cases the perfect
end position is defined as a perfect handstand, or during Pommel
Horse circles, as a perfect cross support or perfect side support
position. For swinging elements the following applies:
a)	On Floor Exercise, Pommel Horse, Rings, Parallel Bars and
Horizontal Bar, swing elements are often expected to be
performed through rather than to an exact handstand otherwise the rhythm of an exercise might be interrupted. For that
reason a small angular deviation of up to 15° from an exact
handstand is permitted up to the conclusion of the element. A
small deduction is taken if the deviation from the handstand
is between 16° and 30°.
b)	On Pommel Horse, circles and most elements must be performed in, from, or to within 15° of a perfect cross or side
support position. The appropriate angular deviation deduction
is taken each time the error occurs during an exercise. This
means that the E - Jury would deduct for each skewed circle,
whereas the D - Jury would not recognize the element if it
deviates from the correct support orientation more than 45°
for the greater portion of the element.
12. During swing elements which pass through or end in handstand
(see additional rule Art. 15.2 for Horizontal Bar), deviations from
the correct position will be penalized as follows:
up to 15º
16° to 30º
31° to 45º
> 45º

No deduction.
Small error.
Medium error.
Large error and non-recognition (D jury).

Note: Deviations in end positions for swinging elements of 45°
and greater (or for twisting elements, of 90° and greater) will
receive a large deduction from the E - Jury and will not be
recognized by the D-jury. However, in some cases, it may be
possible for an element with incomplete twist to be recognized
as a lower value element in accordance with the amount of
twist correctly completed.
13. On Rings, during swings to a hold position, the shoulders may
not rise above the final hold position. If the shoulders rise above
the final hold position, the deduction is:

Small error
Medium error
Large error
Non-recognition

up to 15º.
16° to 30º.
over 30°.
over 45º (D-jury).

14. All hold elements must be held for a minimum of 2 seconds measured from the moment that a complete stop position has been
reached. Elements that are not held will receive large deduction
and will not be recognized by the D-jury.
2 seconds
Less 2 seconds
Non stop

no deduction.
medium error.
large error and non-recognition.

15. Deductions for poor landings are listed in Article 9.4. A correct
landing is a prepared landing, not one which happens by luck to
end in a standing position. An element should be performed with
such excellent technique that the gymnast has fully completed it
and has had time to reduce rotation and/or extend the body prior
to landing.
16. Landings & Dismounts on the Feet without Deduction.
	 For safety reasons a gymnast may land or dismount with their feet
apart (enough to properly join their heels together) upon landing
from any salto. The gymnast must complete the landing by bringing his heels together without lifting and moving the front of his
feet. This is done by raising the heels off the mat and joining them
together without lifting the front of the feet. The arms must also be
in complete control with no unnecessary swings.
17. Additional technical deductions are listed in Article 9.4 and specifically for each apparatus in the appropriate Chapter.

Action (Without steps, hops, or arm
swings)

Result

Landing with feet slightly apart and gymnast lifts heels and joins both heels together without lifting and moving the front of his
feet

No deduction

Landing with feet slightly apart or less than
shoulder width apart and gymnast picks up
a foot moving both feet together, OR does
not join both feet together by lifting only
the heels

0.1 deduction for
landing with feet
apart


Landing with feet more than shoulder width 0.3 deduction for
apart, AND gymnast picks up one foot mov- landing with feet
ing both feet together, OR does not join apart
both feet together

Note:
-	 All other execution deductions (those while in the flight phase of
a salto or for lack of extension before landing) must always be
considered in addition to the landing requirements noted above.

Article 9.3 Expectations for Compositional Exercise Construction
1.	The expectations for Compositional exercise construction are those
aspects of an exercise that define the essence of our expectations
and understanding of a gymnastics performance on each apparatus; such things as using the full floor area; swinging without
stops; no repetition; etc. These are specifically defined for each
apparatus in the appropriate chapter.
2.	Exercise construction errors include, but are not restricted to, the
following:
a)	 Gratuitous separation of legs (medium error = 0.3 p. E-jury):
i.	 The gymnast may not perform elements with a separation
of legs that serves no useful purpose or that detracts from
the aesthetics of a performance. For example, on Parallel
Bars a Stützkehre or a pirouette may not be performed
with legs apart; on Horizontal Bar and Rings, elements
may not be performed with a back-forward separation of
the legs; on Rings, crosses, swallows, and handstands
may not be performed with a separation of the legs; etc.
Most elements permitted or required to be performed with
separated legs are listed in the Difficulty Tables.
b)	Repetition of elements
i.	 Repeating of elements is permitted but they cannot receive credit for difficulty or connection points. However,
they are evaluated normally by the E-jury.
c)	Layaways, empty and intermediate swings (medium or large
error = 0,3 or 0,5 by the E-jury):
i. 	 An empty swing is a swing at the end of which no element
is performed or no new support or hang position or grip
is achieved (medium error by the E-jury).
ii. 	An intermediate swing is two successive empty swings
(large error by the E-jury).
iii. 	Layaways are back swings in support or in upper arm
support that simply reverse direction and swing back
down in or to a lower hang or support position (also if
accompanied by a grip change) (medium error by the
E-jury).
d)	Lowering of Legs on Swings to Handstands.
	 The table below shows the actions to be taken for lowering of
the legs during swings to handstand:

E-Jury & D-Jury action

Angle Deviation from

Section 10: Floor Exercise

Dimensions: 12 m. x 12 m.

Article 10.1 Exercise description
A Floor Exercise is composed predominantly of acrobatic elements
combined with other gymnastic elements such as strength and
balance parts, elements of flexibility, handstands, and choreographic
combinations all forming a harmonious rhythmic exercise which is
performed utilizing the entire floor exercise area (12 m x 12 m).

Article 10.2 Content and Construction

Article 10.2.1 Information about Exercise Presentation
1.	The gymnast must begin his Exercise within the floor area, from
a still stand legs together. The exercise and evaluation begin with
the first movement of the feet of the gymnast.
2.	The gymnast must include only elements that he can perform with
complete safety and with a high degree of aesthetic and technical
mastery.
3.	Additional execution and exercise construction expectations are:
a)	The exercise must occur entirely within the floor area. Elements
initiated outside of the floor area will be evaluated in the normal
fashion by the E-Jury but will not be recognized by the D-Jury.
i.	 The space available for Floor Exercise is delineated by
boundary lines or colour separations. Lines are considered
to be a part of the floor area. The gymnast may step onto
the line, but not over the line or on the outside colour.
ii.	Going outside of the marked floor area will be controlled by
2 line judges who sit diagonally opposite each other near
the FX area. Each line judge observes the 2 boundary lines
nearest him. When line violations occur, the line judge must
advise the D1 judge in writing, using the following criteria:
- 	 Landing or touching with one foot or one hand outside
the floor area = 0,10.
- 	Touching with feet, hands, foot and hand or with any
other part of the body outside of the floor area = 0,30.
- 	 Landing directly outside the floor area = 0,30.
- 	 Elements initiated outside the floor area have no value.
The D1 judge will take the appropriate deduction from the
final score.
iii.	If the gymnast has stepped outside of the floor area, steps
required to return back into the area are not deducted.
b)	The duration of the Floor Exercise is a maximum of 70 seconds
which will be verified by a timer. There is no minimum time.
The Time Judge will give an audible warning signal at 60 seconds and again at 70 seconds to indicate the maximum time
prescribed to the exercise. The time is measured from the first
movement of the feet of the gymnast through to the dismount,
which must end in a standing position with legs together. If
the exercise does not comply with the prescribed time, the
timer will signal the judge D1 who will take the corresponding
deduction from the Final Score.
c)	The full floor area must be used. There is no limit regarding
the amount of times a diagonal may be used in succession for
acrobatic elements. However, the gymnast must go to and/or
from each corner or a 0.3 neutral deduction by the D-jury will
be taken once during the exercise.
d)	Pauses of two seconds or longer before acrobatic series or
elements are not permitted.
e)	Each acrobatic element or series must end in a visibly controlled landing before continuing to a non-acrobatic element.
Uncontrolled momentary landings during such transitions are
not permitted.
f)	 Dive rolls must show a momentary support of both hands; that
is, these may not be performed without hand support or with
contact only on the back of the hands.
g)	The exercise must end with an acrobatic element that lands
with both feet together.
h)	A gymnast must not use simple steps to arrive in the corner.
Simple steps occur when a gymnast repositions himself on
the floor area without any choreography (turning ≥180 degree,
jumping, lifting leg above horizontal during step, etc.).
4.	For a full list of errors and deductions governing Exercise Presentation, see Section 9 and the summary of deductions in Articles 9.4
and 10.3.

Article 10.2.2 Information about the D score
1.	The Element Groups (EG) are:
I. 	Non-acrobatic elements.
II. 	Acrobatic elements forward (saltos and handsprings) and
fwd. rollout elements (no salto).
III. 	Acrobatic elements backward (saltos and handsprings),
and Arabian elements.
2.	The dismount cannot be from Element Group I.
3.	For seniors, a double salto element is required in the exercise and
must be inside the 10 counting elements.
i)	 The deduction for aesthetic and execution errors in the saltos
is per element not for every salto included in the element.
4.	Information about Difficulty and elements group:
a)	Acrobatic elements can be connected but retain their independent values.
b)	For floor exercise, one element can fulfill only one Element
Group requirement. If one element is executed as dismount
(Element Group II, or III), it can fulfill only Dismount Group
requirement, and the gymnast must include one more element from the same Element Group as the dismount inside
the exercise in order to receive the respective Element Group
points. The element used for the dismount is the first of five
counted within a specific element group, except in the instance
of basic repetition.
c)	All Arabian elements are in the group of acrobatic elements
backward, Example Arabian double front ½ = same as double
back 1/1 (D value). The following Arabian elements (Jump
bwd. with ½ t. to double salto fwd.) have the same value and
Code box as the bwd. double salto element with the same
amount of twisting: Arabian dbl. str. ½ (Penev), Arabian dbl.
str. (Tamayo), and Arabian dbl. str. 1/1 (Hypolito).
5.	Information about connections (CV).
- Connections can be awarded on both sides of one element
and is not necessary to be inside 10 counting elements (but no
repetition permitted).
- D or higher + B or C = +0.1, D or higher + D or higher = +0.2
- (No connection for Counter Saltos, example Double salto bwd.
1/1 to salto fwd. 1/1).
- Limit of 2 connections total in an exercise.
6.	Additional information and regulations:
a)	3/2 salto elements with reception by and then spring from the
hands are not permitted.
b)	Saltos rollout and jumps to prone position are not permitted
for value.
c)	All permitted elements that finish with a rollout or finish in front
support position are listed in the Difficulty Tables. For safety
reasons, no new such elements are permitted.
d)	Unless otherwise indicated in the Difficulty Tables, circle and
flair elements have the same value and identification number.
Wende swings with legs apart are not permitted.
e)	Unlisted strength holds with straddled legs are not permitted.
f)	Elements involving two strength parts for one Code value
require a stop position in both strength parts to receive the
listed value, a lower value WILL be awarded if a stop occurs
for only one of the strength parts. Example: Manna (1 s.) and
press handstand (no stop)= C value for the Manna.
g)	All circles/flairs begin and end in front support.
7.	Special repetitions:
a)	A maximum of 2 strength elements (including strength handstands) may be performed in an exercise for content value.
	 Elements I.1 to I.48 are considered to be strength elements,
except:
		 - Element I.19 - Handstand (2 sec).
		 - Element I.31 - ½ or 1/1 turn in handstand or to handstand.
b)	A maximum of 2 circle, flair, or Russian value parts may be
performed in an exercise for content value.
8.	For a further list of regulations governing non-recognition of elements and other aspects of the “D score”, see Section 7 and the
summary of deductions in Article 7.6.
h)	No extra elements may be added before or after element I.94
(Flair to handstand hopping backward handstand pirouettes
and back to flair) for an increase in value.
	 Example: addition of a spindle before I.94 will NOT increase the
value. The MTC has applied a principle where only acrobatic
elements can be awarded more than a D value.
i)	 All Japanese handstands require closing of the legs.

Section 11: Pommel Horse

Height: 105 cm from top of mat, 115 cm from the floor.

Article 11.1: Exercise description
A contemporary Pommel Horse exercise is characterized by a variety
of support positions on all parts of the horse, permitting different
types of circular swings with legs apart and together, single leg
swings and/or scissors, and swings through the handstand position
with or without turns. All elements must be executed with swing and
without the slightest interruption of the exercise. Strength and hold
elements are not permitted.

Article 11.2: Content and Construction

Article 11.2.1 Information about Exercise Presentation
1.	The gymnast must start his exercise from a standing position.
An approach step or hop is permitted. The evaluation begins the
moment the gymnast’s feet leave the floor.
2.	The gymnast must include only elements that he can perform with
complete safety and with a high degree of aesthetic and technical
mastery.
3.	Additional execution, technical and exercise construction expectations are:
a)	The exercise must consist exclusively of swings without visible
pauses or visible use of strength.
b)	Oblique positions during flair and circle work are not permitted.
Circles and flairs may be performed only in cross support or in
side support positions. Furthermore, all turning elements must
begin and end in either cross support or side support.
c)	Ideally circles and flairs must be performed with complete
extension. Lack of amplitude in body position is deducted
as an individual deduction on for each element. Circles with
a slightly hollow position are permitted. Hip breaks during
individual elements in an exercise should be deducted as
separate technical errors on each circle or flair.
d)	Wendeswings must be performed with legs together. Straddled
wendeswings are considered atypical and are deducted appropriately.
e)	During scissors and single leg swings, the gymnast must
demonstrate a significant elevation of his hips and a large
separation of the legs.
f)	 Handstand elements must be achieved with completely straight
arms and without any interruption of swing or obvious use of
strength.
g)	In flair or circle to handstand dismounts and elements returning
to flairs or circles (or support), execution deductions for hesitation, strength, bent arms, lowering of the hips, and unsteadiness must be considered on the rise to the handstand, within
the pirouette, the lower from the handstand, and the extension
of the flairs or circles upon completion of the element. There is
no deduction for bending of the hips on the rise to handstand.
h)	A dismount must normally cross the body of the horse and land
in cross stand facing along the long axis of the horse while
landing adjacent to the last hand support position.
i)	 A simple handstand dismount must cross the horse in order to
be recognized. A handstand dismount does not have to cross
the horse provided that It includes a turn of at least 270º from
the side support or 360º from the cross support.
j)	 Expectations for scissor to handstand elements:
-	 The gymnast is expected to swing to handstand without
strength or hesitation, with hips stretched throughout.
-	 A scissor to handstand with pronounced hip bend and
strength should receive these two separate deductions
from the E jury.
-	 Scissors to handstands demonstrating swing with strength
and/or lowering of the hips or legs will be deducted by the
E jury.
-	 All scissors to handstand require the legs to close.
k)	Clarifications concerning evaluation for Li Ning Scissor to
handstand performed with hand(s) stepping errors:
-	 Step down off pommel with one hand with return to the
single pommel = D value (D jury) and -0.3 + other execution errors (E jury) for uncontrolled handstand support.
-	 Step down off pommel with one hand with no return to the
single pommel= D value (D jury) and -0.5 + other execution errors (E jury) for uncontrolled handstand support.
-	 Step down off pommel with two hands= no value (D jury)
and -0.5 or -1.0 (dependent on continuance of exercise
or fall) + other execution errors (E jury).
	 Note: All other scissors to handstand with support of both hands
on the leather = no value (D jury) and -0.5 or -1.0 (dependent
on continuance of exercise or fall) + other execution errors (E
jury).
l) All dismounts other than handstand dismounts must be executed with the body at a minimum angle of 30º above the
shoulder horizontal line before landing. For angles lower than
30º, deductions will be applied according to the specific errors
and deductions table for pommel horse, Art. 11.3.
m) If a gymnast believes he did not receive value for his dismount,
he may repeat any dismount for value (one time only) within
30 seconds of completing the original attempt. If the original
dismount received a large deduction, and the dismount is
repeated, the large deduction must be increased to -1.0 by
the E jury.
4.	For a full list of errors and deductions governing Exercise Presentation, see Section 9 and the summary of deductions in Articles 9.4
and 11.3.

Article 11.2.2 Information about the “D score”
1.	The Element Groups (EG) are:
I. 	 Single leg swings and scissors.
II. 	Circle and flairs, with and/or without spindles and handstands, Kehrswings, Russian wendeswings, flops and
combined elements.
III. 	Travel type elements, including Krolls, Tong Fei, Wu
Guonian, Roth and Traveling Spindles.
IV. 	Dismounts.
2.	Additional information and regulations:
a)	General
a.1)	Unless otherwise indicated elements on the leather have
the same value as those performed on two pommels.
a.2)	Unless otherwise indicated all ½ turns (Czechkehres,
Stöckli and reverse Stöckli, double Swiss), have the same
value.
a.3)	Unless otherwise indicated, each element is defined as
occurring within one structure and ending when a new
structure is initiated, as follows (Exception: the combined
series provision):
i.	 A hop element ends at the completion of the hop or
series of hops.
ii.	 A circle or flair element ends when it changes to the
other.
iii.	 A spindle element ends when the spindle action stops.
iv.	 A front support element (wendeswing) ends when the
wende action stops.
v.	 Travel elements in cross support end when the travel
action or the cross support position is either interrupted by a circle or some other element or is ended
in some other way.
vi.	 For difficulty recognition purposes, travelling elements
can be considered finished as soon as the travel is
completed, front support position with both hands on
the applicable part of the horse.
viii.	In the Code of Points Belenki, Urzica, and Moguilny
(EG III) may begin from cross support (also facing
out) minus 90º on first turn AND final turn, with travel
from one end to the other
a.4)	From side sup. on 1 end., travel bwd. over both p. to
side sup. on the other end (3/3) in 2 circles w.- must be
completed with no pommels for D value.
a.5)	No partial value will be given to any travel element with a
fall. Example: Magyar travel with fall after the first pommel
while attempting to continue the travel action will receive
no value.
a.6)	All Sohn and Bezugo type elements from a stand (and not
from a circle element) will be valued two letters lower than
the value from the listed element in the Code of Points.
a.7)	A Russian Wendeswing to a dismount beginning in cross
support facing out must complete Russian(s) as listed
before the Wende to receive full dismount value.
a.8)	A Wu Guonian requires a minimum 360° of body turn to be
completed with one or two hands between the pommels.
a.9)	Tong Fei elements can be performed with 4 different types
of start/end positions. Three of these types require a full
circle to be completed after the end position (side to cross,
cross to side, cross to cross) for value.
a.10) No partial value will be given to any travel element
with a fall. Example: Magyar travel with fall after the first
pommel while attempting to continue the travel action
will receive no value.
a.11) No additional elements may be added to increase the
value of these elements:
•	 Kehre fwd., rev. Stöckli, kehre fwd. (Element III.64,
Moguilny).
•	 Kehre bwd., kehre fwd., kehre bwd. (Element III.70,
Belenki).
b)	Circles
b.1)	Unless otherwise indicated, all circle elements begin and
end in front support.
b.2)	Unless otherwise indicated, the value and identification
numbers of elements performed in circle or flair are identical. Such elements are illustrated at random in either the
circle or the flair positions throughout the Difficulty Tables.
This means Element II.28 can be performed several different ways:
•	 With legs together, side support 1/1 spindle inside
max 2 circles
•	 With legs straddled, side support 1/1 spindle inside
max 2 circles
•	 With legs straddled, side support 1/1 spindle inside
max 2 circles with hands outside of one pommel
b.3)	All basic circles in cross and side support (also on one
pommel) may end with a ¼ turn without changing the
structure or value of the element.
b.4)	Step up to pommel, with or without ¼ turn, is B value
Circle with ¼ turn on one pommel, and counts as start
to flop sequence (Element II.14).
c)	Handstand
c.1) 	There is no upgrade in value for turning within a handstand from scissors.
c.2)	 There is no upgrade in value for the performance of turning within a handstand (from circles or flairs) solely on the
pommels. Turning within a handstand requires a majority
use of the leather.
c.3)	When performing a 3/3 travel during a handstand (within
an exercise or dismount), “support” with one hand must
be shown on both ends of the horse to receive the 3/3
upgrade in value.
c.4)	Increases in Value for Handstands from circle or flairs:
1.	Circle or flair handstand dismounts.

*3/3 travel requires minimum 180º turn.
3. Circle or Flair Handstand and lower to circle/flair.
*3/3 travel requires minimum 180º turn.
c.5)	Swing with strength and/or lowering of the hips or legs
in achieving handstands from a scissor or from circles or
flairs (including dismounts) will receive the value for the
element and element group (D jury) with E-jury deductions. However, if there is a large error, no recognition will
be given for the handstand or dismount. In the case of a
large deduction, the gymnast will receive a -0.5 deduction
and only deductions for aesthetic errors (legs, feet, bent
arms, touch horse, etc.). No deductions for strength or
angle will be applied.
c.6)	All scissors through handstand on one pommel require
a change of arm or pommel to receive value.
d) Combine elements
d.1)	It is possible to combine certain elements on a single
pommel. There are two types of such combined elements
listed in the Element Group II:
i.	 Flop type elements may include combinations of any
of the following on one pommel: circle in side support
(with or without ¼ turn), circle in cross support (with
or without ¼ turn), Direct Stöckli B, and/or Direct
Stöckli A; and may include a maximum of two of the
same element in direct succession. Such combined
elements (flops) can only be of D or E value (i.e. 3
or 4 elements). As an exception a D flop performed
in flair = E, and an E flop performed in flair = F. Only
one such flop sequence may be used in an exercise

1 flop

for value.
The following examples illustrate this rule:
•	DSB + DSB + DSA = D value flop.
•	Circle on one pommel + DSB + DSB + DSA = E
value flop

ii.	 Combined sequences on one pommel of circle and/
or Stöckli A or B with Russian wendeswings. The
circle and/or Stöckli B can either precede or follow
the Russian wendeswings and must appear as 2
consecutive circle elements to be part of a two-flop
Combined Sequence. The DSA may only appear at
the end of the sequence. Only one of these combined
sequences may be used during an exercise.

iii.	 In any case when a combined element is involved,
the gymnast will not have the right to make use of
the same element three times in direct succession.
iv.	 Flop and combined elements must be separated
by minimum one circle with one hand off of the one
pommel
v.	 A DSB is considered finished in side support frontways on one pommel.
d.2)	No other double elements will be credited for higher
value. For example: 2 circles or 2 DSB’s in any position
receive credit only for the first circle or DSB and no value
or recognition for the second.
d.3)	DSA requires ¼ turn in and ¼ out.
e) Spindles
e.1)	Spindles in EG II in cross or side support with legs together or flair must be performed within a maximum 2
circles (3 front support positions after the original start
position) for D value.
e.2) There are two D value 1/1 Spindles (EG II) in the Code
of Points:
•	 Any side support 1/1 spindle w. legs strad. inside max.
2 circles- Element II.28.
•	 Any cross support 1/1 spindle within max. 2 circles.
(also with 1/3, ½ or 2/3 travel) (Magyar)- Element II.34.
	 Both may be performed in the same exercise.
f)	 Dismounts
f.1)	 Pommel Horse is the only apparatus where a dismount
may be repeated (one time only) if the gymnast determines he may not have received credit because of a fall or
a large deduction. This must be done within the allowable
time. If the gymnasts steps off the podium (this includes
the stairs), the exercise is terminated.
f.2)	 In the case of a repeated dismount, the gymnast has 30
seconds to remount the horse and perform any type of
dismount of his choice for value and EG IV.
f.3)	 Examples of repeating a PH dismount are:

3. Special repetitions:
a)	A maximum of two (3/3) cross support travels (forwards and/
or backwards) are permitted during the exercise. This rule
applies to the following six travels ONLY:
•	 III.45 Travel fwd.in cross support with support on leather,
pommel, pommel, leather(3/3) (1-2-4-5), C value.
•	 III.46 Any other travel fwd. in cross support to other end

pommel, pommel, leather(3/3) (5-4-2-1), C value.
•	 III.58 Any other travel bwd. in cross support to other end
(3/3) (Sivado), D value.
	 i.e. Nin Reyes type elements (3/3 travel with spindle) are NOT
considered with this rule.
b)	A maximum of two Russian Wendeswings are permitted for
value in an exercise, including the dismount. Excluded from
the rule are flop/ Russian combinations on one pommel, Kroll
(III.81), Roth (III.82), Wu Guonian (III.83), and Tong Fei type
elements (III.75, 76, 87, 89) elements.
c)	A maximum of 2 handstand elements are permitted for value
in an exercise from circles, flairs, or scissors (not including the
dismount).

Section 12: Rings

Height: 280 cm from the floor.

Article 12.1 Exercise description
An exercise on the Rings is composed of swing, strength and hold
parts in approximately equal portions. These parts and combinations
are executed in a hang position, to or through a support position,
or to or through the handstand position, and execution with straight
arms should be predominant. Contemporary gymnastic exercises are
characterized by transitions between elements of swing and strength
or the reverse. The swinging of the cables and the crossing of the
cables are not permitted.

Article 12.2 Content and Construction

Article 12.2.1 Information about Exercise Presentation
1.	From a still stand, the gymnast must jump or be assisted to a still
hang on the Rings with legs together, and with good form. The
evaluation begins with the first movement of the gymnast from the
moment he leaves the floor. The coach is not permitted to give the
gymnast an initial swing.
2.	The gymnast must include only elements that he can perform
with complete safety and a high degree of aesthetic and technical
mastery.
3.	All exercises should contain an approximately equal distribution
of swing, hold and strength elements. Consequently, an exercise
cannot include more than three elements from groups II and/or III
in direct succession.
4.	Back swings in support that do not lead to at least a value part but
simply reverse direction and swing back down in or to a lower hang
position are deducted by the E-jury. A typical example of such a
layaway on rings is: from a kip to support, swing back to layaway
to front uprise.
5.	Additional Technical, aesthetic and execution aspects in the exercise construction expectations are:
a)	Hold positions must be reached directly, with straight arms,
and without need for positional or postural corrections.
b)	All hold positions must be held for a minimum of 2 seconds.
c)	Upward swings must lead to or through a handstand, or directly
to a strength hold element whenever the nature of the swing
permits.
d)	During all swing to strength hold elements, the shoulders
may not rise above the level of the final hold position. Any
deviation will result in the appropriate deductions by the E-
jury and, depending on the nature of the element, may lead
to non-recognition by the D-jury.
e)	Swing elements that lead to strength hold elements which must
reverse direction (i.e. front uprise to Swallow; front uprise to
inverted cross and so on…) will be counted as two elements.
f)	 A false grip (over grip) for strength holds is not permitted. A
false grip is performed with the wrists bent in order to gain an
advantage in performing a strength element, deduction -0.1
each time.
	 No false grip: straight wrists with or without the fingers of the
hands wrapped around the Rings.
	 Note: The position of the rings in the hands (with straight wrists
and open hands) does not change the evaluation (no false
grip).
g)	Straight arms must be used whenever the nature of the element permits it.
h)	 Composition errors with deductions of -0,30 points. Example:
	 Honma to support then lift to L sit OR Straddle L sit to L sit
OR Kip to support then L sit, etc.
i)	 Only for strength elements to handstand with bent arms,
where the necessary technique requires minimal touching of
the straps with the lower arms, no deduction should be taken
for contact with the straps (Elements II.25 and II.26).
6.	Yamawaki/Jonasson elements showing a full support or pause
will receive a 0.5 deduction for swing with strength (receiving
non-recognition). These elements with less support shown will
be recognized with small and medium deductions for swing with
strength.
7.	Gymnasts demonstrating very little change in body position after
moving from one hold position to another are subject to execution
deductions and possible non-recognition (i.e: Swallow to support
scale and Hanging scale rearways to Swallow).
8.	For a full list of errors and deductions governing Exercise Presentation, see Section 9 and the summary of deductions in Articles 9.4
and 12.3.

Article 12.2.2 Information about the “D score”
1.	The Element Groups (EG) are:
I.	 Kip and swing elements & swings through or to handstand
(2 sec.).
II. 	 Strength elements and hold elements (2 sec.).
III. 	 Swing to Strength hold elements (2 sec.).
IV. 	Dismounts.
2.	Repeated elements (same Code Identification Number) cannot
contribute to the “D” score. On Rings, this rule is extended so that
not more than 3 elements from groups II and/or III can be presented
in direct succession. The 4th and subsequent Elements from Group
II and/or III of the same sequence will be considered as repetition,
and not recognized by the D jury. However if the gymnast decides
to execute more elements from Element Groups II and/or III, in
order to be recognized by the “D” Jury, he must perform at least a
B value swing element from elements Group I (except any kind of
kip/back kip, or element in the same Code box) between the first
sequence of maximum 3, and another element or sequence from
Element Groups II and/or III.
	 This swing element of at least a B value must have to be among
the 10
3.	Special repetitions:
a)	Repeated elements (same Code Identification Number) cannot
contribute to the “D” score. On Rings, this rule is extended so
that a maximum of 1 final strength position in each EG may be
recog­nized for difficulty. Thus, for example only two cross type
elements (regular, L cross, or V cross) or support scale type
elements (regular or straddled) are permitted in an exercise for
difficulty value (one in Group II and one in Group III).
b)	A maximum of 2 Guczoghy and a maximum of 2 Li Ning type
elements can be present in the exercise, the 3rd and subsequent
within either type of element will be considered as repetition.
4.	Additional information and regulations:
a)	All holds must be held for a minimum of 2 seconds. They will
be not recognized by the “D” Jury for Difficulty and/or Elements
Group requirements if no stop position is shown.
b)	Strength presses and lifts which follow a previous hold element
and end in a 2 second hold position are recognized only if the
preceding hold part has been recognized and if a stop position
is shown.
c)	Elements with crossing of the cables are not permitted, being
deducted as composition errors.
d)	For juniors, elements which include saltos backward in hang
and Li Ning type elements are not permitted.
e)	Pineda type elements must be executed with straight body,
straight arms, a momentary hold in the front lever and slowly
to avoid deduction or classification as a swing to strength
element.
f)	 Yamawaki/Jonasson elements showing a full support or pause
will not be recognized for difficulty. A Honma to support and
fwd. swing out to hang will not be recognized as separate
values because of the gymnast’s intent.
g)	All V hold positions (2 sec.) must be performed with legs vertical. This is the same as the requirement for Floor Exercise.
h)	An exercise must start in a hang position with arms vertical
and straight. The gymnast may NOT bend their arms in moving to the first position unless specifically needed for element
completion. Example: Cast up and underswing backward may
be started with bent arms any time during an exercise.
i)	 During an exercise, a gymnast may only bend their arms during a transition between elements when necessary to properly
perform the next element.
j) For the hold of a non-listed part for 2 seconds or more, deduct
-0.1 each time. Some elements typically featuring this problem
(hold of 2 sec. or more) include: inverted hang, inverted pike,
and dorsal hang.
k)	Nakayama elements must pass through a complete hanging
scale rearways to prevent execution deductions and potential
non-recognition.
l) A dorsal hang to Cross or V Cross is not an acceptable entry
position to elevate the value for either cross (or any other
strength element). If either cross is performed directly from a
dorsal hang, each will retain its independent Code of Points
value (B and C respectively).
m) One Swing to handstand element (2 s. hold) is required in the
exercise and must be inside 10 counting elements.
5.	For a further list of regulations governing non-recognition of elements and other aspects of the “D score”, see Section 7 and the
summary of deductions in Article 7.6.

Section 13: Vault

Height: 135 cm measured from the floor

Article 13.1 Description of a Vault Exercise
The gymnast must perform one vault except in Qualification for Vault
Finals and in Vault Finals where he must show two vaults from different Vault Groups and with different 2nd flight phases (for higher
difficulty vaults). For example: different direction - fwd./bwd and/or
different position - tucked/piked (for simple saltos) or minimum ½ turn
difference (for twisting saltos and simple flights). Each vault begins
with a run and a takeoff from both feet (with or without a round off) to
the vault board with legs together and is executed with a brief support
phase on the table with two hands. The vault may contain single or
multiple turns around the two axes of the body. After the first vault,
the gymnast returns without delay to the starting position and, at the
signal of the D1 Judge, performs his second vault.

Article 13.2 Content and construction

Article 13.2.1 Information about Exercise Presentation
1.	The gymnast must begin vault from a still stand with legs together
at a maximum distance or 25 meters, measured from the front edge
of the table to the inner side of the block attached at the end of the
vault run up mat. The vault begins with the first step or hop of the
gymnast, but the evaluation begins the moment his feet contact
the vaulting board. The length of the approach must be marked
on or alongside the approach lane.
2.	The vault ends with a landing behind the table in a standing position with legs together facing either towards or away from the table
(frontways or rearways).
3.	The gymnast must show only vaults that he can perform with
complete safety and with a high degree of aesthetic and technical
mastery. He is required to show the Identification Number of his
intended vault before he vaults.
4.	The gymnast may take-off only forwards or backwards and with
legs together. The only element that may be performed before the
vaulting board is a round off. For such vaults, the use of the vaulting board safety “collar” is mandatory and must be provided by
the competition organizer. For round-off entry vaults, the gymnast
may use one official handy-mat provided only by the organizer.
5.	Vaults with saltos during the first flight phase and vaults with
straddled legs are neither listed nor permitted.
6.	The gymnast must show the intended body position (tucked, piked,
or stretched) in a distinct and unmistakable manner. Indistinct body
positions are deducted by the E-Jury and may result in recognition
as a lower value vault by the D-Jury.
7.	Basis for the Evaluation by the E-Jury:
a)	First flight phase, up to the support with two hands.
b)	2nd flight phase, including the pushing off from the table up
to the landing in a standing position. The gymnast must demonstrate a distinct rise in the height of his body after push off
from the table.
c)	Body position in the momentary support on the table.
d)	Deductions with regard to the deviation from the extended axis
of the table.
e)	Technical execution during the entire vault.
f)	 The landing.
8.	Landing Rules:
a)	The gymnast must land with both feet within an area marked
left and right of the extended centre line of the table as described in the following draw.
	 These lines must be clearly marked on the landing mat. Stepping on the line, but not over the line, is permitted.
	 The mat containing the marked landing zone for alignment
must be securely fastened so that it cannot shift during competition.
b)	Twisting during vaults must be completed before landing.
Incomplete twists result in the appropriate deduction, and if
incomplete by 90° or more, will result in non-recognition by
the D-jury and in recognition as a vault with a lower Difficulty
Value.
9.	In the 2nd flight phase, the gymnast must show a conspicuous rise
in height of his center of gravity at the moment of hand push-off.
10. Salto vaults tucked or piked must display a distinct opening phase
in preparation for landing. A landing that is not prepared is a sign of
an error in technique and will usually result in a technical execution
deduction as well as a landing deduction.
11. For a full list of errors and deductions governing Exercise Presentation see, Section 9 and the summary of deductions in Articles
9.4 and 13.3.

Article 13.2.2 Information about the D score
1.	The gymnast must show one vault in Qualification, Team Final
and the All-Around Final. In the Qualification for Vault Final and in
Vault Finals he must show two vaults, which must be from different

Vault Groups (for all vaults) and which may not have the same or
similar 2nd flight phases (for the higher difficulty vaults).
Group I
Group II
Group III
Group IV
Group V

Handspring .
1/4 or 1/2 tw in 1st flight.
Round off entry.
Round off with 1/2 tw in 1st flight.
Scherbo entry in 1st flight

2.	Each vault is listed, numbered, and given a value in the Difficulty
Tables within its Group. The following general principles apply:
a)	Cuervo vaults have the same value as equivalent Handspring
Salto vaults with twists.
b)	Kasamatsu vaults have the same value as the equivalent
Tsukahara vaults.
c)	Yurchenko vaults have the same value as the analogous
Tsukahara or Kasamatsu vaults.
d)	Unless otherwise indicated, round-off entry vaults with ½ turn
to the table have a value of 0.20 more than the analogous
forward approach vaults.
e)	Unless otherwise indicated, round-off entry vaults with ¾ or 1/1
turn to the table have a value of 0.60 more than the analogous
Tsukahara vaults.
3.	Each vault is given a unique Difficulty Value based on its complexity.
4.	Prior to the execution of each vault, the appropriate vault number,
as assigned in the Code of Points must be displayed for the D-jury.
This function is performed by the gymnast, or an assistant, with
the aid of a flashboard and is not penalized in the case of error.
Example: #319 - The #3 designates the vault group; the
#19 designates the vault number within that vault group.
5.	The gymnast must show the intended body position (tucked, piked,
or stretched) in a distinct and unmistakable manner. Non-distinct
body positions may result in non-recognition by the D-Jury or
recognition as a vault with a lower Difficulty Value. (see the body
position definitions in Appendix A Section 3). The gymnast must
display the vault number for the vault that he can do, not the one
he hopes to do. This warning applies especially for the recognition
of stretched and piked positions.
6.	The placement mat may be used for roundoff entry vaults only,
and is optional.
7.	The vault is invalid (0.00 point from the D-Jury and the E-Jury)) when:
a)	The vault is executed without a support phase, i.e., neither
hand touches the table.
b)	Failure to use the safety collar for round-off entry vaults.
c)	The vault is so poorly executed that the intended vault cannot
be recognized, or the gymnast pushes from the table with his/
her feet.
d)	Spotting assistance during the vault.
e)	The gymnast does not land with his feet first. This means that
at least one foot must contact the landing mat before any other
part of the body.
f)	 The gymnast lands intentionally in a side stand.
g)	The gymnast performs a prohibited vault (straddled legs, salto
in first flight, prohibited pre-element before the vaulting board,
etc.).
h) The first vault is repeated for the second vault in Qualification
for Vault Final or in Vault Final.
A video review by D- panel and Apparatus supervisor will automatically occur for every vault receiving an Invalid “0 “Score.
All E-Jury judges enter their deductions after every vault performed. The D jury will notify them in the case of a “0” vault and
advise them of the method to present a “0” E-score.
7.	In Qualification, Team Final, and All-Around Final:
	 • One vault must be performed.
	 • In Qualification, the 1st vault score counts toward the Team and/
or All-Around Total.
	 For Qualification and in the Apparatus Final, each gymnast must
perform two different vaults which must be from different Vault Groups
(for pages 1 & 2 of Vault Value Table) and which may not have the same
or similar 2nd flight phases (for page 2 of the Vault Value Table only).
	 In Qualification and in the Apparatus Final, the average score
of the 2 vaults will determine the final score for the gymnast.
8.	Additional run approaches are permitted as follows, with deduction
of 1.00 for empty run (if gymnasts has not touched the springboard
or apparatus).
-	 When 1 vault is required, a second run approach is permitted
with deduction. Third approach not permitted.
-	 When 2 vaults are required, a third run approach is permitted
with deduction. Fourth approach not permitted.

Section 14: Parallel Bars

Height: 180 cm from top of mat, 200 cm from floor.

Article 14.1 Exercise Description
A contemporary parallel bar exercise consists predominantly of swing
and flight elements selected from all available Element Groups and
performed with continuous transitions through various hang and
support positions in such a way as to reflect the full potential of the
apparatus.

Article 14.2 Content and Construction

Article 14.2.1 Information about Exercise Presentation
1. The gymnast must initiate his Parallel Bar mount or his run-up
from a still stand with legs together. The exercise begins the moment the feet leave the ground. Swinging with one leg or stepping
into the mount is not permitted. The feet must leave the ground
simultaneously.
2.	A vaulting board placed at the height of the regulation landing mats
is permitted for the mount.
3.	Pre-elements are not permitted. This means that any element that
rotates more than 180º around any body axis may not be performed
prior to grasping the rail or rails with the hands.
4. The gymnast must include only elements that he can perform
with complete safety and a high degree of aesthetic and technical mastery.
5. Additional execution and exercise construction expectations are:

a)	Back swings in support or upper arm hang that do not lead to at
least a value part but simply reverse direction and swing back
down in or to a lower hang or support position are deducted,
i.e:
•	 Back swing in upper arm hang, layaway to glide kip.
•	 Back swing in support, layaway to front uprise.
•	 Back swing in support, layaway to hang.
•	 Glide kip to upper arm hang or to momentary support and
lay back to upper arm hang.
•	 From handstand, lower to shoulder roll forward.

b)	No extra support is allowed during elements with turns on
one arm support. Elements such as giant swing with turn,
backward uprise with turn, forward uprise with full turn, Felge
elements with turn, etc. will be considered finished where the
extra support occurs.
c)	All elements in hang followed by kips must be executed with
straight legs.
d)	The following elements or groups of elements are not permitted:
•	 Strength and hold elements that are not listed in the difficulty tables.
•	 Saltos and dismounts from side hang on one bar.
•	 Saltos with reception in upper arms and/or bent arms
support for juniors.
e)	Elements performed to one bar (Chiarlo, Piasecky, etc..) must
be executed to a handstand with hands slightly apart. A slight
deviation of the shoulders/body is permitted because of the
unnatural hand position. Deductions will be taken for excessive
hand separation and/or body deviation.
f)	 On all Moy and Giant Bwd. swings, legs may not bend until
body is horizontal.
g)	The deduction for lack of extension before regrasping after
saltos means the extension (opening) should be at horizontal
(bar height).
6. For a full list of errors and deductions governing Exercise Presentation, see Section 8 and the summary of deductions in Article 14.3.

Article 14.2.2 Information about the “D score”
1.	The Element Groups (EG) are:
I.	 Elements in support or through support on 2 bars.
II. 	Elements starting in upper arm position.
III. 	Long swings in hang on 1 or 2 bars and underswings.
IV. 	Dismounts.
2. Information on difficulty value:
a)	For elements which include turns, the turns are not recognized
as part of the element if the turn happens after the handstand
position or after a hop to handstand. Examples: basket with
inlocation and hop to handstand with turn or giant swing half
turn with hop to handstand followed by turns.
b)	Unless otherwise indicated, elements that deliberately re-grasp
in bent arm support are considered to have the same identification number and value as elements which re-grasp in upper
arm support. However, elements that are initiated from bent
arm support are considered to have the same identification
number and value as elements from or through support.
c)	Unless otherwise indicated in the difficulty tables, elements
performed from or to unusual or rotated grip positions (supinated or pronated) have the same identification number and
value as analogous elements performed from or to the usual
grip position.
d)	Elements formed by combined independent elements must
demonstrate no pause between elements, or they will receive
their independent values.
e)	In the Qualifications or Team Finals, for preparation of the
Parallel Bars prior to an exercise (during the one-touch warmup and competition), any FOP accredited person from the
federation of the gymnasts may assist. In the All-Around or
Apparatus Finals, a maximum of three people (the competing
gymnast, coach, and 1 other FOP accredited person may be
on the podium to prepare the bars.
3.	Additional information and regulations:
a)	Many swinging elements lead to or are defined to a handstand
on one or two rails. The handstands from swing need not be
held but the element must be performed in a manner that
convincingly demonstrates that the handstand position could
have been held if so desired.
b)	Special rule: Elements to one bar in cross support have the
same value as done to two bars, except they increase by one
value more when connected to Healy type elements (each
Healy element also increases by one value)- hold is allowed
in the one bar handstand.
c)	 Elements to one bar upgrade the value if is connected to healy
type elements, but only if the healy element is executed without
large deduction.
d)	No straddle element to one bar can receive an increase in
difficulty value, i.e. Tippelt, Arican, etc.
e)	How to evaluate Makuts type elements with a pause or stop
during the first part of the element:

Performance

Jury D

Jury E

Performance

D-jury

E-jury

Pause after first part
of element

Give value

-0.1 for Pausing or
Stopping in Handstand

One second hold
after first part of
element (less than 2
seconds)

Give value

-0.3 for Pausing or
Stopping in Handstand

Two second hold
after first part of
element

No value

-0.5 for Pausing or
Stopping in Handstand

	 For example: Makuts to handstand with less than a one second
hold after the ¾ Diamidov and then ¾ Healy = E value and
-0.1 for Pausing or Stopping in handstand.
f)	 All Healys must have 360° or more turns to be recognized as
a Healy type element.
	 i.e. From a swing element (minimum B value) to handstand
on one bar sideways, requires a Healy (450° turn) to support
for an E value.
	 Note: A ¾ Healy, from sideways position, is a B value and
same box as Element I.44.
4.	Special repetitions:
a)	Elements with saltos: an exercise can not include more than
one variation of the same element (within the same EG). In
this case the element with the highest difficulty value will be
counted for difficulty.
Some examples:
- 	Morisue tuck or Morisue pike.
- 	Belle tuck or Belle pike.
- 	5/4 Salto fwd straddled to up. arm hang or to bent arm
support or through support to hang/directly to hang.
b)	Maximum two Giant Swings to handstand (III. 21, 22, 28, 29
& 35).
c)	 Maximum two Basket Swings to handstand (III. 106, 107, 114,
119, 120, 130,136).
5. For a further list of regulations governing non-recognition of elements and other aspects of the D score, see Section 9 and the
summary of deductions in Articles 9.4 and 14.3.

Section 15: Horizontal Bar

Height: 260 cm from top of mat, 280 cm from the floor.

Article 15.1 Exercise description
A contemporary Horizontal Bar Exercise must be a dynamic
presentation that consists entirely of the fluid connection of swinging,
turning, and flight elements alternating between elements performed
near to and far from the bar in a variety of hand grips so as to
demonstrate the full potential of the apparatus.

Article 15.2 Content and Construction

Article 15.2.1 Information about Exercise Presentation
1.	The gymnast must jump or be assisted to a still or swinging hang
on the Horizontal Bar from a still stand with legs together or from a
short run, but always with good form. The evaluation begins from
the moment the gymnast leaves the floor.
2.	The gymnast must include only elements that he can perform
with complete safety and a high degree of aesthetic and technical
mastery.
3.	Other execution and exercise construction expectations are:
a)	The exercise must consist entirely of swings without stops or pauses.
b)	Deviations in swings to or through handstand, including turns.

c)	Flight elements must demonstrate a conspicuous rise of the
body during the flight phase.
d)	Backward swings to handstand that simply reverse direction
and swing back down in the reverse direction are deducted
(composition errors) each time with 0,30 points.
	 Specific examples of such layaways are:
•	 Following a kip cast or back uprise to handstand - layaway
to giant swing bwd., Stalder, free hip, ½ turn to el-grip, etc.
•	Following a backward uprise to handstand and hop to
overgrip - swing forward to giant swing bwd., Stalder, free
hip, etc.
(Also other angle deductions also need to be applied for
missing the handstand position).
e)	Any flight element with salto over the bar requires a giant swing
afterward or -0.3 (E-jury deduction).
f) For all Adler elements it is not required to enter from a handstand position.
4.	For a full list of errors and deductions governing Exercise Presentation, see Section 9 and the summary of deductions in Articles 9.4
and 15.3.

Article 15.2.2 Information about the D score
1.	The Element Groups are (EG):
I.	 Long hang swings with and without turns.
II. 	Flight elements.
III. 	In bar and Adler elements.
IV. 	Dismounts.
2.	Information about Connections (CV).

3.	Additional information and regulations:
a)	Unless otherwise indicated, the value and identification numbers of elements listed in the Difficulty Tables are the same if
performed from handstand, from a back swing, or from some
other position.
b)	Unless otherwise indicated, elements have the same difficulty
value and identification number when performed with the
“wrong grip” or atypical grip positions.
c)	Elements that end in a double elgrip have one letter superior
value than the same elements ending in one arm elgrip.
d)	Unless listed in the Difficulty Tables, elements with or from feet
on the bar are not permitted (exception: Piatti elements).
e)	Starting or re-grasping flight elements with one hand (or “wrong
grip”) has the same value and identification number as starting
or re-grasping with two hands.
f)	 Elements with turns must show the turns as an integral part
of the element being performed and the turn must be initiated
on the way up (exception Endo type elements).
g)	Elements with hops to handstand, which include turns, must
initiate the turn during the hop and must re-grasp with the
second hand only after the turn has been completed. A regrasp may occur initially with one hand and then the second
hand as the turn is completed. A hop element is considered
finished at the moment that both hands re-grasp the bar.
h)	El-grip elements meet only the requirements for the Element
Group in which they are listed.
I.	 Flight elements from el-grip are considered to belong to
Element Group II.
II.	 Dismounts from el-grip are considered to belong to Element Group IV.
III.	Endo swings in el-grip are considered to belong to Element Group III.
i)	 Expectation for Rybalko:
•	 Prerequisite condition for Rybalko is both hands in el-grip
in end position.
•	 Visible hop and fluid turn, not the turn on supporting arm.
j)	 Turning elements in one hand support position must be considered as finished at the moment the gymnast re-grasps the
bar with the second hand.
k)	Unless otherwise indicated, an element composed of two
separate elements will result in divided values when a grip
change occurs. (i.e. Endo in overgrip, change one hand to
undergrip, and 1/1 turn to el-grip = B+C).
4.	Unless otherwise indicated, for elements of Group I and III, the
following principles are used for the determination of difficulty:
a)	Value of the base element has been given a certain value.
•	A ½ turn does not increase the difficulty.
•	A 1/1 turn increases the difficulty by one letter.
•	A1/1 turn or greater to both el-grip increases the difficulty
by two letters.
•	A hop does not increase the difficulty.
•	Re-grasp in double el-grip increases the difficulty by one
letter.
b)	The element has the same value and identification number
whether it crosses the bar or not, as long as the amplitude
stipulations have been met.
5.	Flight elements from el-grip and dismounts from el-grip or dorsal
hang have the same value as elements performed in regular grip.
6.	Special repetitions:
a)	A maximum of two Stoop Circle Rearward forward through
handstand elements (Adler type) are permitted. In this case
the elements with the highest difficulty value will be counted.
b)	Elements with turns: an exercise cannot include more than
one grip variation of the same element. The second executed
one in chronological order is considered as repetition.
Examples:
•	 If a Rybalko in double el grip is executed, another Rybalko
in mixed grip or one hand grip is not permitted.
•	 If an Endo with 1/1 turn in mixed grip is executed, another
Endo with 1/1 turn in double el grip is not permitted.
•	 If a Stalder ½ turn in double el grip is executed, another
Stalder ½ turn in mixed grip is not permitted.
7.	Regrasping Tkatchev ½ or Yamawaki ½ elements without sufficient
turning and continuing to handstand (or directly connecting to a
release element) will receive the value for the identical element
listed in the code of points without a ½.
8.	For an el-grip or Russian giant to be recognized directly after an
Adler or turn to el-grip, the el-grip or Russian giant requires a swing
over the bar in el-grip in order to receive a value.
9.	A Zou Li Min executed with insufficient turning (greater than 90°
deviation on first full twist) will not be recognized by the D-jury
and receive a -0.5 deduction by the E-jury. This element may not
be devalued to a Giant Swing Fwd. with one arm in undergrip (B
value).
11. The Yamawaki element must be stretched when passing through
a vertical body position over the bar for no deductions. An excessive pike or a poor vertical position over the bar will be deducted
and could also lead to recognition of a B value flight element.
12. Yamawaki ½ will need to have all turning continue in the same
direction for the increase in letter value. If the element turns in two
different directions, the element will not be recognized by the D
jury. This element has the same twisting specification as all other
elements in the Code of Points.
13. Flight elements always receive value when two hands regrasp
the bar and a distinct hang phase is shown before the gymnast
falls. If the catch is performed with one arm, the value is given to
the gymnast when two hands have finally regrasped the bar or
another element has been clearly initiated.
14. A Rybalko to one arm with additional ½ or 1/1 turn. Numerous
variations of these elements have been proposed. The MTC will
not permit any additional turning in order to raise the value of
any Code of Points listed elements performed on one arm for the
safety of all gymnasts.
15. Giant swing bwd. with hop 3/2 t. to one arm giant swing (Rybalko
to one arm giant swing) is the same value and box as Rybalko to
undergrip or mixed el-grip (Element I.63).
	 Note: This rule also applies to all Stalder Rybalko type elements.
16. One arm giant swing fwd. w. 1/1 t. to el-grip and 1/1 t. to ugr. (Zou
Li Min, Element I.27) cannot be combined with any other element
for an increase in value.
17. Endo in el-grip thr. hdst. (Element IV.39): As long as the hands are
in el-grip during the entry of the legs, a hop out to undergrip, mixed
grip, or overgrip afterward is permitted without a loss of value.
18. How to determine evaluate el-grip combinations:
	 An El-grip giant swing (Element IV.14) and Giant swing rearways
fwd. (Russian giant, Element IV.15) only require going over the top
of the bar in el-grip to receive their listed value. No specific amount
of a giant swing in el-grip is required in order for the element to be
recognized.
	 Sequence examples:
1. Adler to 50° from handstand, swing in-elgrip through the bottom
and over the top, swing in elgrip through the bottom and hop
out to undergrip= No value for Adler (and -0.5 angle deduction)
and B value el-grip giant.
2. Adler to handstand, swing in el-grip through the bottom and over
the top into el-grip Endo, swing through the bottom in el-grip
Endo, and hop out to undergrip = C value Adler, B value el-grip
giant, C value el-grip Endo.
19. Flights elements with ½ turns to mixed el-grip must have more
than 50% of the turn completed upon catching the bar in order to
receive no deduction while continuing to back uprise to handstand.
E-jury deductions of small, medium, large should be applied for
any insufficient turning upon catching the bar.
20. Stoop circle fwd. to straddle cut to hang or sup. (Element II.1)Gymnast may enter at any angle from a giant swing or swing
forward.

summary of deductions in Article 7.6.

PART IV
Appendices

Appendix A
Additional Explanations & Interpretations

1.	The text in the difficulty tables supersedes the illustrations.
2.	(See Art. 7.4.m) This rule is interpreted, in part, as follows:
a)	Twisting elements on all six apparatus will not be recognized
if they are performed with a 1/4 twist (90°) short of or beyond
the specifications for the intended element
b)	Swinging elements on all appropriate apparatus will not be
recognized if they are completed 45° or greater from the perfect or the prescribed end position. On the Horizontal Bar this
means, for example, that a free hip circle can be performed
up to 45° past a handstand and still be recognized by the DJury. On the Parallel Bars, for example, a Stützkehre must be
performed to at least 45° above horizontal to be recognized by
the D-Jury. A stretched position is considered piked if at any
time during the element a pike of greater than 45° is shown.
3.	 (See Section 9.1.1) Being performed with perfection implies also
that elements be performed with the specified body position. The
following definitions will apply.
a)	A perfect stretched body position is one in which a line from
the shoulders through the hips to the ankles is straight for
static elements and straight or slightly bent forwards or backwards during dynamic elements. If the hip assumes a flexion
of greater than 45° at any time during the element, it will be
considered piked.
b)	A perfect piked body position is one in which the knees are
straight and the hips are bent at least 90°. Errors include a
pike of less than 90° from the extended position and/or an
additional bending of the knees. If the knees assume a flexion
of greater than 45° at any time during the element, it will be
considered tucked.
c)	A perfect tuck position is one during which the hips are strongly
bent and the bent knees are brought to the chest - a minimum
90° bend in each. Errors include a hip bend of less than 90°
from the extended position and/or a knee bend of less than
90°.
d)	A stretched position with a knee flexion of 90° is considered
to be stretched but with a large error. If this occurs during an
element it will not be recognized by the D-jury.
e)	A straddled position must be shown with the maximum separation of the legs that the aesthetic and technical nature of the
element allows.
f)	 Each of the salto positions - tucked, piked, stretched, straddled
- is expected to be demonstrated so distinctly and conspicuously as to leave no doubt about the intent.
g)	A regular handstand on all apparatus is one with the body
perfectly aligned and without arch. A wide arm handstand on
Floor Exercise requires the head to be within one hand width
of the floor.
h)	Strength holds on all affected apparatus require, depending
on the element, the arms to be perfectly horizontal, and/or the
body to be perfectly horizontal, and/or the legs to be perfectly
horizontal.
i)	Certain dynamic elements when poorly performed can be
confused with other elements. Some typical examples include:
i.	 Twisting elements on all apparatus that over- or under-turn
by more than 90º.
ii.	 On Pommel Horse; cross support travels which are
oblique by more than 45º versus travels in side support.
iii.	 On Vault; handspring forward with salto (Group I) versus
¼ turn in preflight and ¼ turn off with salto forward (Group
II).
	In all such cases, the gymnast is obligated to demonstrate
the element he wishes to show in a distinct and unmistakable
manner. Failure to do so will always result in a large deduction
from the E-jury and non-recognition by the D-jury (or on Vault,
recognition as the element and Group with the lower value).
j)	 Exceptions can be made if the correct technical execution of
an element requires a modification of these definitions.
4.	 (See Section 9.1.4) This, along with Article 5.2.b is a most important directive for all judges especially with the stated expectation
that all elements be performed to perfect end positions. The judge
must at all times use his gymnastics knowledge and gymnastics
sense. The following examples may be instructive.
a)	It is possible to perform elements such as a Tkatchev to a
handstand on Horizontal Bar but it is not yet a reasonable, nor
perhaps a desirable, expectation. It is reasonable, however,
to expect in all cases that the element be performed with
technique of such excellence that the gymnast has had time
to prepare for the re-grasp, that it occur with straight arms,
and that it permit continuation with a smooth full swing.
b)	It is possible to perform a dislocate to handstand from inverted
hang on Rings, but it would certainly be an exception. The
deduction for not completing this element in handstand would
not apply.
c)	Some elements have a special purpose or effect and if such
purpose is conspicuous and aesthetic it would be exempt from
the usual amplitude requirements.
d)	It is possible to perform a reverse Stützkehre on Parallel Bars
through a handstand but that is essentially a different element
(it is listed as such in the Difficulty Tables) and should not
become the regular expectation for a reverse Stützkehre.
e)	There exist a small number of elements (bent arm vs. straight
arm press on several apparatus; amplitude on scales on Floor
Exercise; V-sits vs. high V-sits (Manna) on several apparatus;
planche vs. swallow on Rings) where intermediate positions
make recognition for the D-jury and evaluation difficult for
the E-Jury. The gymnast is expected to show his intended
position or performance so distinctly and conspicuously as to
leave no doubt about the intent. Intermediate or non-distinct
positions are always deducted by the E-Jury and may lead to
non-recognition by the D-jury.
5)	Parts of the pommel horse.
	 To assist in the definition of circles and travels in side support or
cross support, the parts of the horse are defined according to the
following diagrams.

Article 5.7 Judge’s Oath (TR 7.12)
At the World Championships, and other important international
events, juries and judges pledge to respect the terms of the Judges’
Oath:
“In the name of all the judges and officials, I promise that we shall
officiate in these World Championships (or any other official FIG
Event) with complete impartiality, respecting and abiding by the rules
which govern them, in the true spirit of sportsmanship.”
Article 5.8 MAG Naming of New Elements
Any new element performed at an FIG registered competition with an
official FIG TD or FIG MTC member participating, in an accredited
role and in attendance during the performance, is eligible for new
element recognition in the Code of Points. A video of the completed
element must be given to the TC member in attendance for later
review and evaluation at the following MTC meeting.

Section 6
The Evaluation of Competition Exercises
Article 6.1 General Rules
1.	Two separates scores, “D” and “E”, will be calculated on all apparatus.
-	 The D-jury determine the “D” score, the content of an exercise,
and the E-jury the “E” score, i.e. the exercise presentation
related to compositional requirements, technique and body
position.
-	 “D” score content will include by addition:
-	 The additional difficulty value of 10 elements (8 for
juniors), the best 9 (7 for juniors), but maximum 5 elements for the same Element Group, inside the best
counting plus the value of the dismount. If the judge
needs to choose the counting 9 (7 for juniors) elements
from elements which have the same value but belong to
different Element Groups, he must determine them to the
benefit of the gymnast. Once the 9 (7 for juniors) best
counting elements plus the dismount of the exercise are
determined, the judge must count among them not more
than 5 elements from the same element group (for FX,
the Element Group of the dismount will count first).

-	 The connections value, based on special rules on different
apparatus.
-	 Element Group Requirements Value, performed among
the 10 counting elements (8 for juniors).
-	 “E” score, will start from 10 points and will evaluate by deductions applied in tenths of a point:
-	 The total deductions for aesthetic and execution errors.
-	 The total deductions for technical and compositional errors.
-	 The highest and the lowest sums of total deductions applied
in tenths of a point for execution, aesthetic, technical and
compositional errors are eliminated. The average remaining
20
sums is subtracted from the 10 points in order to determine
the Final “E” Score.
Article 6.2 - Determination of the Final Score
1. The Final Score of an exercise will be established by the addition
of the “D” and final “E” scores.
2.	The rules governing the evaluation of the exercises and the determination of the Final Score are identical for all sessions of optional
competition (Qualification, Team Final, All Around Final, Apparatus
Finals) except for Vault, where special rules in Qualification and in
Apparatus Finals apply (see Section 13).
3.	The All-Around Score is the sum of the Final Scores obtained on
the six exercises.
4.	The Team Score is calculated in accordance with the current
Technical Regulations that govern that competition.
5.	Qualification for, and participation in, the Team Final, the All Around
Final, and the Apparatus Finals will occur in accordance with the
current Technical Regulations that govern that competition.
6.	The Final Score is normally calculated by the competition scoring
personnel but must be confirmed by the Apparatus Supervisor
before it is displayed.
7.	At official FIG competitions, the single “D” score from the D-jury
and the “E” score (the average of exercise presentation deductions
subtracted from 10 from each judge of the E-jury) will be displayed.
Each individual score of the E-jury will appear on the main results
form. At all other competitions, the “D” score, “E” score and the
Final Score must be displayed.
For exercise presentation, the gymnast may earn a maximum
E- Score of 10.00 points.
The D -Panel will take the appropriate neutral deduction (penalty)
for a short exercise from the Final Score.
- 4.0 points
- 6.0 points
- 8.0 points
7 or more elements 	- 0.0 points
5 - 6 elements

Section 7
Regulations Governing the D score (DV)
Article 7.1 Difficulty
1.	On Floor Exercise, Pommel Horse, Rings, Parallel Bars, and
Horizontal Bar, the following difficulty values will count in all competitions:
forma:
Parties	A	 B	 C	D	 E	 F	 G	H
Values	 A	 B	 C	D	 E	 F	 G	H
parts
Value	 0.10	0.20	0.30	0.40	 0.50	 0.60	0.70	0.80

21
2.	To the extent possible, only single elements are included in the
Difficulty Tables. Each element is given a unique difficulty value
and a unique Code Identification Number.
3.	Elements that are not listed in the Difficulty Tables must be submitted for a difficulty rating to the Chair of the Superior Jury 24
hours in advance of podium training at official FIG Competitions.
Provisional difficulty ratings may be given by Technical Authorities
at other international, national, and local competitions.
5.	Elements that no longer appear in the Code are usually not permitted or fall below the value of an A.
6.	Elements in same box with different values may be performed in
the same exercise with both elements contributing to the “D” Score.
IV.
Article 7.2 Element Group and Dismount Requirements
1.	With this evaluation category, the judge evaluates those required
movement patterns which, in addition to the gymnast’s personal
inclinations and technical abilities, are intended to enhance the
variety of movement in the construction of an exercise.
2.	Each apparatus has three Element Groups designated as I, II, III,
and, except for Floor Exercise, a Dismount Group designated as
IV.
3.	In his exercise, the gymnast must include at least one element
from each of the three Element Groups.
4.	An element may meet the Element Group requirement only for the
Element Group under which it is located in the Difficulty Tables.
5.	Each Element Group requirement fulfillment (inside the 10 counting
elements) is awarded with 0.5 points by the D-jury.
6.	Every exercise must end with a legitimate dismount listed under
the Dismount Element Group. (see Section 10 and 13 for specific
regulations for Floor Exercise and Vault). Non-legitimate dismounts
include:
i.	 A dismount that pushes off the feet (except on Floor Exercise).
ii.	An exercise finished with a partially shown or incomplete
dismount.
iii.	A dismount that does not land on the feet (including rollout
elements on Floor Exercise).
iv.	A dismount that intentionally lands sideways.
IV.
incompleta.
NB. Such elements always lead to non-recognition by the D-jury
of the element and the Element Group.
4.	An element (or element with the same Code Identification Number)
may be repeated but such repeated element may not contribute
towards the “D” score. See additional regulations restricting repetition for Pommel Horse and Rings in Section 11 and 12.
22
7.	Regarding Dismount element group requirements, the following
rule will be applied:
- A or B value dismount 	 0.00 p. (does not fulfill requirement).
- D or higher value
+0.50 p. (full requirement value).
For juniors:
0.00 p. (does not fulfill requirement).
- C or higher value
+0.50 p. (full requirement value).
Article 7.3 Connection Points
1.	This evaluation factor provides the D-jury with the possibility of
awarding special connections. Thereby, these Connection Points
serve to better differentiate the exercises which contain special
connections between elements, as particularly described on each
apparatus.
2.	Connection Points may be awarded only for directly connected
recognized high valued elements performed without a large error.
Article 7.4 Evaluation by the D-jury
1. The D-jury is responsible for evaluating the content of the exercise and determining the correct “D” score on each apparatus as
defined in Sections 10 to 15. Except in the circumstances defined
in Article 7.4 the D-jury is obligated to recognize and credit each
legal element that is correctly performed.
2.	The gymnast is expected to include in his exercise only elements
that he can perform with complete safety and with a high degree of
aesthetic and technical mastery. Very poorly performed elements
will not be recognized by the D-jury and will be deducted by the
E-jury.
3.	Each element is defined to the perfect end position or as being
performed with perfection.
4.	An element that is not recognized by the D-jury will receive no
value.
5.	An element will not be recognized by the D-jury if it deviates significantly from the prescribed execution. An element will not be
recognized or credited for reasons including, but not necessarily
restricted to, the following:
a)	If, on Floor Exercise, the element is performed beginning
outside of the floor area (see Section 10 Art. 10.2.1.3a).
b)	 If, on Vault, the gymnast performs an invalid Vault as defined
in Section 13.
c)	 If on Horizontal Bar, an element is performed with or from feet
on the bar (see Section 15).
d)	 If a hold element with straddled legs not listed in the difficulty
tables is performed on any apparatus.
e)	 If the element is so altered in performance that it can no longer
lay any claim to its identification number or value (see also
Appendix A.3.1), for example:
i.	 A strength element performed almost entirely with swing.
23
ii.	 A swing element performed almost entirely with strength.
iii.	A stretched position element performed with a distinct
tuck or pike or vice versa. In such cases an element is
normally given the value of the element as performed.
iv.	 A strength element normally performed with legs together
is performed with legs straddled.
v.	 A strength hold element performed with significantly bent
arms.
vi.	 An element in or to handstand on Rings that is controlled
with the legs or feet against the cables.
f)	 If the element has been completed with the assistance of a
spotter.
g)	If the gymnast falls on or from the apparatus during an element,
or alters, or interrupts it in some other manner.
h)	If the gymnast falls on or from the apparatus during an element
without having reached an end position that permits continuation with at least a swing.
i)	 If a strength hold element or a simple hold element is not held.
j)	 If a press or pull out comes from a strength hold element which
has not been recognized or credited for any reason.
k)	If a twisting element on most apparatus is performed with
an over- or under-rotation of 90° or greater or if a swinging
element is performed with a deviation from the perfect end
position of 45° or greater (see also Appendix A.3.1). In some
circumstances, especially on Vault, an over- or under-rotation
of 90° may result in the recognition of different value for the
vault by the D-jury.
l)	If, on Pommel Horse, elements in cross support or in side
support deviate from the correct support orientation by 45° or
greater for the greater portion of the element.
m) If strength hold positions or simple hold positions on any apparatus deviate from the correct horizontal body, arm, or leg
position by 45° or greater. This means, for example:
i.	 Inverted cross with the head of the gymnast entirely above
the circle of the rings. (This is usually >45°).
ii.	 Cross with the arm pits entirely above the circle of the
rings. (This is usually >45°).
iii.	 (see also Article 9.2.8).
6.	In all cases, the D-jury is to make decisions based on gymnastics
sense and to decide in the interests of the sport of gymnastics. In
cases of doubt, the benefit of that doubt must be given to the gymnast.
7.	Elements performed so poorly that they are not recognized by the
D-jury will normally be severely deducted by the E-jury as well.
24
8.	The elements with the highest difficulty values will be counted first
in cases of Special Repetition.
9.	For recognition of difficulty on Pommel Horse and Floor Exercise,
the dismount is always counted first.
Article 7.5 Repetition
1.	An exercise may not be repeated unless the gymnast has to interrupt his exercise for reasons outside of his control.
2.	If the gymnast falls on or from the apparatus, he may choose to
continue with his exercise from the fall or to repeat the missed
element for credit and continue from there. (See Article 9.2.5).
3.	No element (same Code Identification Number) may be repeated
for difficulty credit or for Connection Points. This applies also to
elements repeated in connections (exceptions: certain Pommel
Horse elements and circles that increase in value if performed
twice in special combinations, and Rings - see Section 11 and 12).
4.	If the difficulty of an element is not recognized for any reason, then
that element can also not meet an Element Group Requirement.

Section 8
Regulations Governing E score
Article 8.1 Description of Exercise Presentation
1.	The Exercise Presentation consists of only those factors that constitute the essence of a contemporary gymnastics performance and
the absence of which results in deductions by the E-jury. These
factors are:
a)	The technical, compositional (general expectations for exercise
construction) aesthetic and execution.
2.	The Exercise Presentation has a maximum value of 10.0 points.
Article 8.2 Calculation of E-jury deductions
1.	The judges of the E-jury, will judge an exercise and determine
the deductions independently and do so within 20 seconds of the
completion of the exercise.
2.	Each performance is evaluated with reference to expectations
of perfect performance. All deviations from this expectation are
deducted.
a)	Deductions for errors in aesthetic and execution, technique
and composition are summed to a maximum of 10.0 points
for Exercise Presentation.
Article 8.3 Instructions for the Gymnast
1.	The gymnast must include in his exercise only elements that he
can perform with complete safety and with a high degree of aesthetic and technical mastery. The responsibility for his safety rests
entirely with him. The E jury is required to deduct very rigorously
for any aesthetic, execution, composition and technical errors.
2.	The gymnast must never attempt to increase the difficulty or the
“D” score at the expense of aesthetic and technical execution.
3.	All mounts must commence from the basic stand position, from
a short run (only Parallel Bars and Horizontal Bar), or from a still
hang. Pre-elements or intermediate elements may not precede
the mount. This rule does not apply to Vault where the specific
rules stated for that apparatus apply.
4.	Dismounts from all apparatus as well as the conclusion on Floor
Exercise and Vault must end in a standing position with the legs
together. With the exception of Floor Exercise, pushing from the
apparatus with the feet in order to execute the dismount is not
Section 9
Section 9
Technical Directives
Article 9.1 Evaluation by the E - jury
1.	The E-Jury is responsible for evaluating all of the aesthetic,
execution and technical performance aspects of an exercise as
well as its compliance with the composition (exercise construction
expectations) for that apparatus. In each case the E -Jury is to
demand that elements be performed with perfection and to perfect
end positions (see also Appendix A.2).
26
2.	The gymnast is expected to include in his exercise only elements
that he can perform with complete safety and with a high degree of
aesthetic and technical mastery. All deviations from that expectation will be deducted rigorously by the E-jury.
3.	The E-jury is not to concern at all with the difficulty of an exercise.
He is obligated to deduct equally severely for any error of the
same magnitude regardless of the difficulty of the element or the
connection.
4.	Judges of the E-Jury (and the D-jury) must remain up-to-date with
contemporary gymnastics, must know at all times what the most
contemporary performance expectation for an element should be,
and must know how standards are changing as the sport evolves.
In this context they must also know what is possible, what is
reasonable to expect, what is an exception, and what is a special
effect (see also Appendix A.3).
5.	The E-Jury must understand to refrain from deducting when some
elements, which otherwise have no errors, are performed for a
special effect or a special purpose. For example:
i.	 On Parallel Bars, a basket or a giant swing deliberately performed with flight and travel, and with a late re-grasp has a
special effect and purpose and should not be deducted for not
ending in handstand. However the onus is on the gymnast to
show the effect or purpose in an unmistakable and conspicuous manner.
ii.	On Horizontal Bar, a giant swing is often modified in preparation for release elements and dismounts. These should not be
deducted for not passing through a handstand unless they are
unnecessary or so extreme as to violate aesthetic, execution
and technical expectations.
6.	If for any reason a judge of the E-Jury cannot reach a decision,
he must give the benefit of the doubt to the gymnast.
7.	The E-jury is obligated to deduct twice for two distinctly different
errors in an element, i.e. if the element has both a technical and
Bars may receive both deductions for insufficient amplitude and
for bent knees.
Article 9.2 Determination of Execution and Technical Errors
1.	Each element is defined to the perfect end position or as being
performed with perfection. (See also Part IV).
2.	All deviations from correct performance are considered execution or technical errors and must be evaluated accordingly by the
judges. The amount of the deduction for small, medium, or large
errors is determined by the degree of deviation from the correct
performance. The same deduction is applied each time for the
same severity of bending, whether it be the arms, legs, or the body.
27
0,1 p.
0,3 p.
0,5 p.
1,0 p.
3.	The following deductions will apply for each and every discernible aesthetic or technical deviation from the expected perfect
performance. These deductions must be taken regardless of the
difficulty of the element or exercise.
Small Error
Fall
0.1 p.
0.3 p.

a)	Small errors: (deduction = 0.1)
i.	 Any minor or slight deviation from the perfect end position
and from perfect technical execution.
ii.	 Any minor adjustments to hand, foot, or body position.
iii.	 Any other minor violations against aesthetic and technical
performance expectations.
b)	Medium errors: (deduction = 0.3)
i.	 Any distinct or significant deviation from the perfect end
position and from perfect technical execution.
ii.	 Any distinct or significant adjustments to hand, foot, or
body position.
iii.	 Any other distinct or significant violation against aesthetic
and technical performance expectations.
i.	 Any major or severe deviation from the perfect end position and from perfect technical execution.
ii.	 Any major or severe adjustments to hand, foot, or body
position.
iii. Any full intermediate swing.
iv.	Any other major or severe violations against aesthetic
and technical performance expectations.
d)	Falls and spotter assistance: (deduction = 1.0 p.)
i.	 Any fall on or from the apparatus during an element
without having reached an end position that permits continuation with at least a swing (i.e. a distinct hang phase
on Horizontal Bar or a distinct support phase on Pommel
Horse after the element in question) or that otherwise
fails to display a momentary control of the element during
landing or re-grasp.
ii.	 -1.0 is the maximum deduction for an element with a fall,
and including all steps, touches, or support on the floor
or mat leading up to the fall. Other execution deductions
incurred for the element (height, landing extension, insufficient twist) still apply.
iii.	 Any assistance by a spotter that contributes to the completion of an element.
4.	On all apparatus at the end of the exercise, if a gymnast does not
perform a dismount, but lands intentionally on the feet, no deduction for a fall will be considered.
28
Petite faute:

	Exemples:
5.	After a fall on or from the apparatus, the exercise may be continued
within 30 seconds and the gymnast may use a necessary number
of elements or movements to return to his starting position but all
of these elements and movements must be performed with perfect
execution. He is permitted to repeat the missed element for credit,
except if the fall occurred during a dismount (except Pommel
Horse) or a Vault.
salto.
6.	Execution errors such as bent knees, bent arms, bad posture or
body position, poor rhythm, poor amplitude, etc. are listed in Articles
9.2 and 9.3 and are always deducted according to the degree of
error or deviation from what is considered perfect performance.
7.	Execution errors such as bending the arms, legs or body are
categorized as follows:
Small Error:
8.	For strength hold or simple hold positions on any apparatus, angular deviations from the perfect hold position define the magnitude
of the technical error and the corresponding technical deduction:
	 up to 15°
		Examples:
		 Ejemplos:
29
Petite faute
a)	Deviations in hold positions of 30° and greater will receive a
large deduction from the E-jury. In addition, deviations of 45°
and greater will lead to the non recognition of the element by
the D-jury.
9.	A press from a static strength element that did not have its difficulty recognized for any reason will also not have its difficulty
recognized.
10. If the preceding strength hold element has received a deduction
for incorrect position, then the same deduction up to a maximum
of 0.30 points applies again to a press from that strength hold element if it is determined that the press has been simplified thereby.
This interpretation is intended only for circumstances where a high
position or a technically poor hold makes the subsequent press
easier (i.e. not for presses from faulty L sits, false grips, or for
time of hold positions). This deduction only applies to a high angle
deduction being applied to both elements connected by strength..
11. Technical deductions for angular deviation from the perfect end
position can also apply to swinging skills. In most cases the perfect
end position is defined as a perfect handstand, or during Pommel
Horse circles, as a perfect cross support or perfect side support
position. For swinging elements the following applies:
a)	On Floor Exercise, Pommel Horse, Rings, Parallel Bars and
Horizontal Bar, swing elements are often expected to be
performed through rather than to an exact handstand otherwise the rhythm of an exercise might be interrupted. For that
reason a small angular deviation of up to 15° from an exact
handstand is permitted up to the conclusion of the element. A
small deduction is taken if the deviation from the handstand
is between 16° and 30°.
b)	On Pommel Horse, circles and most elements must be performed in, from, or to within 15° of a perfect cross or side
support position. The appropriate angular deviation deduction
is taken each time the error occurs during an exercise. This
means that the E - Jury would deduct for each skewed circle,
whereas the D - Jury would not recognize the element if it
deviates from the correct support orientation more than 45°
for the greater portion of the element.
12. During swing elements which pass through or end in handstand
(see additional rule Art. 15.2 for Horizontal Bar), deviations from
the correct position will be penalized as follows:
up to 15º
Large error and non-recognition (D jury).
30
Note: Deviations in end positions for swinging elements of 45°
and greater (or for twisting elements, of 90° and greater) will
receive a large deduction from the E - Jury and will not be
recognized by the D-jury. However, in some cases, it may be
possible for an element with incomplete twist to be recognized
as a lower value element in accordance with the amount of
twist correctly completed.
13. On Rings, during swings to a hold position, the shoulders may
not rise above the final hold position. If the shoulders rise above
the final hold position, the deduction is:
Non-recognition
up to 15º.
14. All hold elements must be held for a minimum of 2 seconds measured from the moment that a complete stop position has been
reached. Elements that are not held will receive large deduction
and will not be recognized by the D-jury.
2 seconds
Less 2 seconds
Non stop
large error and non-recognition.
15. Deductions for poor landings are listed in Article 9.4. A correct
landing is a prepared landing, not one which happens by luck to
end in a standing position. An element should be performed with
such excellent technique that the gymnast has fully completed it
and has had time to reduce rotation and/or extend the body prior
16. Landings & Dismounts on the Feet without Deduction.
	 For safety reasons a gymnast may land or dismount with their feet
apart (enough to properly join their heels together) upon landing
from any salto. The gymnast must complete the landing by bringing his heels together without lifting and moving the front of his
feet. This is done by raising the heels off the mat and joining them
together without lifting the front of the feet. The arms must also be
in complete control with no unnecessary swings.
17. Additional technical deductions are listed in Article 9.4 and specifically for each apparatus in the appropriate Chapter.

Nota:
Article 9.3 Expectations for Compositional Exercise Construction
1.	The expectations for Compositional exercise construction are those
aspects of an exercise that define the essence of our expectations
and understanding of a gymnastics performance on each apparatus; such things as using the full floor area; swinging without
stops; no repetition; etc. These are specifically defined for each
apparatus in the appropriate chapter.
2.	Exercise construction errors include, but are not restricted to, the
following:
a)	 Gratuitous separation of legs (medium error = 0.3 p. E-jury):
i.	 The gymnast may not perform elements with a separation
of legs that serves no useful purpose or that detracts from
the aesthetics of a performance. For example, on Parallel
Bars a Stützkehre or a pirouette may not be performed
with legs apart; on Horizontal Bar and Rings, elements
may not be performed with a back-forward separation of
the legs; on Rings, crosses, swallows, and handstands
may not be performed with a separation of the legs; etc.
Most elements permitted or required to be performed with
separated legs are listed in the Difficulty Tables.
b)	Repetition of elements
i.	 Repeating of elements is permitted but they cannot receive credit for difficulty or connection points. However,
they are evaluated normally by the E-jury.
32
c)	Layaways, empty and intermediate swings (medium or large
error = 0,3 or 0,5 by the E-jury):
i. 	 An empty swing is a swing at the end of which no element
is performed or no new support or hang position or grip
is achieved (medium error by the E-jury).
ii. 	An intermediate swing is two successive empty swings
(large error by the E-jury).
iii. 	Layaways are back swings in support or in upper arm
support that simply reverse direction and swing back
down in or to a lower hang or support position (also if
accompanied by a grip change) (medium error by the
E-jury).
d)	Lowering of Legs on Swings to Handstands.
	 The table below shows the actions to be taken for lowering of
the legs during swings to handstand:

A Floor Exercise is composed predominantly of acrobatic elements
combined with other gymnastic elements such as strength and
balance parts, elements of flexibility, handstands, and choreographic
combinations all forming a harmonious rhythmic exercise which is
performed utilizing the entire floor exercise area (12 m x 12 m).
Article 10.2 Content and Construction
Article 10.2.1 Information about Exercise Presentation
1.	The gymnast must begin his Exercise within the floor area, from
a still stand legs together. The exercise and evaluation begin with
the first movement of the feet of the gymnast.
2.	The gymnast must include only elements that he can perform with
complete safety and with a high degree of aesthetic and technical
mastery.
3.	Additional execution and exercise construction expectations are:
a)	The exercise must occur entirely within the floor area. Elements
initiated outside of the floor area will be evaluated in the normal
fashion by the E-Jury but will not be recognized by the D-Jury.
i.	 The space available for Floor Exercise is delineated by
boundary lines or colour separations. Lines are considered
to be a part of the floor area. The gymnast may step onto
the line, but not over the line or on the outside colour.
ii.	Going outside of the marked floor area will be controlled by
2 line judges who sit diagonally opposite each other near
the FX area. Each line judge observes the 2 boundary lines
nearest him. When line violations occur, the line judge must
advise the D1 judge in writing, using the following criteria:
- 	 Landing or touching with one foot or one hand outside
the floor area = 0,10.
- 	Touching with feet, hands, foot and hand or with any
other part of the body outside of the floor area = 0,30.
- 	 Landing directly outside the floor area = 0,30.
- 	 Elements initiated outside the floor area have no value.
The D1 judge will take the appropriate deduction from the
final score.
iii.	If the gymnast has stepped outside of the floor area, steps
required to return back into the area are not deducted.
37
b)	The duration of the Floor Exercise is a maximum of 70 seconds
which will be verified by a timer. There is no minimum time.
The Time Judge will give an audible warning signal at 60 seconds and again at 70 seconds to indicate the maximum time
prescribed to the exercise. The time is measured from the first
movement of the feet of the gymnast through to the dismount,
which must end in a standing position with legs together. If
the exercise does not comply with the prescribed time, the
timer will signal the judge D1 who will take the corresponding
deduction from the Final Score.
c)	The full floor area must be used. There is no limit regarding
the amount of times a diagonal may be used in succession for
acrobatic elements. However, the gymnast must go to and/or
from each corner or a 0.3 neutral deduction by the D-jury will
be taken once during the exercise.
d)	Pauses of two seconds or longer before acrobatic series or
elements are not permitted.
e)	Each acrobatic element or series must end in a visibly controlled landing before continuing to a non-acrobatic element.
Uncontrolled momentary landings during such transitions are
not permitted.
f)	 Dive rolls must show a momentary support of both hands; that
is, these may not be performed without hand support or with
contact only on the back of the hands.
g)	The exercise must end with an acrobatic element that lands
with both feet together.
h)	A gymnast must not use simple steps to arrive in the corner.
Simple steps occur when a gymnast repositions himself on
the floor area without any choreography (turning ≥180 degree,

and 10.3.
Article 10.2.2 Information about the D score
1.	The Element Groups (EG) are:
I. 	Non-acrobatic elements.
II. 	Acrobatic elements forward (saltos and handsprings) and
fwd. rollout elements (no salto).
III. 	Acrobatic elements backward (saltos and handsprings),
and Arabian elements.
2.	The dismount cannot be from Element Group I.
3.	For seniors, a double salto element is required in the exercise and
must be inside the 10 counting elements.
i)	 The deduction for aesthetic and execution errors in the saltos
is per element not for every salto included in the element.
38

4.	Information about Difficulty and elements group:
a)	Acrobatic elements can be connected but retain their independent values.
b)	For floor exercise, one element can fulfill only one Element
Group requirement. If one element is executed as dismount
(Element Group II, or III), it can fulfill only Dismount Group
requirement, and the gymnast must include one more element from the same Element Group as the dismount inside
the exercise in order to receive the respective Element Group
points. The element used for the dismount is the first of five
counted within a specific element group, except in the instance
of basic repetition.
c)	All Arabian elements are in the group of acrobatic elements
backward, Example Arabian double front ½ = same as double
back 1/1 (D value). The following Arabian elements (Jump
bwd. with ½ t. to double salto fwd.) have the same value and
Code box as the bwd. double salto element with the same
amount of twisting: Arabian dbl. str. ½ (Penev), Arabian dbl.
str. (Tamayo), and Arabian dbl. str. 1/1 (Hypolito).
5.	Information about connections (CV).
- Connections can be awarded on both sides of one element
and is not necessary to be inside 10 counting elements (but no
- D or higher + B or C = +0.1, D or higher + D or higher = +0.2
- (No connection for Counter Saltos, example Double salto bwd.
1/1 to salto fwd. 1/1).
- Limit of 2 connections total in an exercise.
6.	Additional information and regulations:
a)	3/2 salto elements with reception by and then spring from the
hands are not permitted.
b)	Saltos rollout and jumps to prone position are not permitted
for value.
c)	All permitted elements that finish with a rollout or finish in front
support position are listed in the Difficulty Tables. For safety
reasons, no new such elements are permitted.
a pecho.
d)	Unless otherwise indicated in the Difficulty Tables, circle and
flair elements have the same value and identification number.
Wende swings with legs apart are not permitted.
e)	Unlisted strength holds with straddled legs are not permitted.
f)	Elements involving two strength parts for one Code value
require a stop position in both strength parts to receive the
listed value, a lower value WILL be awarded if a stop occurs
for only one of the strength parts. Example: Manna (1 s.) and
press handstand (no stop)= C value for the Manna.
39
g)	All circles/flairs begin and end in front support.
7.	Special repetitions:
a)	A maximum of 2 strength elements (including strength handstands) may be performed in an exercise for content value.
	 Elements I.1 to I.48 are considered to be strength elements,
except:
		 - Element I.19 - Handstand (2 sec).
		 - Element I.31 - ½ or 1/1 turn in handstand or to handstand.
b)	A maximum of 2 circle, flair, or Russian value parts may be
performed in an exercise for content value.
excepto:
8.	For a further list of regulations governing non-recognition of elements and other aspects of the “D score”, see Section 7 and the
summary of deductions in Article 7.6.
h)	No extra elements may be added before or after element I.94
(Flair to handstand hopping backward handstand pirouettes
and back to flair) for an increase in value.
	 Example: addition of a spindle before I.94 will NOT increase the
value. The MTC has applied a principle where only acrobatic
elements can be awarded more than a D value.
i)	 All Japanese handstands require closing of the legs.

Section 11: Pommel Horse
Height: 105 cm from top of mat, 115 cm from the floor.
A contemporary Pommel Horse exercise is characterized by a variety
of support positions on all parts of the horse, permitting different
types of circular swings with legs apart and together, single leg
swings and/or scissors, and swings through the handstand position
with or without turns. All elements must be executed with swing and
without the slightest interruption of the exercise. Strength and hold
elements are not permitted.
Article 11.2: Content and Construction
Article 11.2.1 Information about Exercise Presentation
1.	The gymnast must start his exercise from a standing position.
An approach step or hop is permitted. The evaluation begins the
moment the gymnast’s feet leave the floor.
2.	The gymnast must include only elements that he can perform with
complete safety and with a high degree of aesthetic and technical
mastery.
3.	Additional execution, technical and exercise construction expectations are:
a)	The exercise must consist exclusively of swings without visible
pauses or visible use of strength.
b)	Oblique positions during flair and circle work are not permitted.
Circles and flairs may be performed only in cross support or in
side support positions. Furthermore, all turning elements must
begin and end in either cross support or side support.
son:
c)	Ideally circles and flairs must be performed with complete
extension. Lack of amplitude in body position is deducted
as an individual deduction on for each element. Circles with
a slightly hollow position are permitted. Hip breaks during
individual elements in an exercise should be deducted as
separate technical errors on each circle or flair.
d)	Wendeswings must be performed with legs together. Straddled
wendeswings are considered atypical and are deducted appropriately.
e)	During scissors and single leg swings, the gymnast must
demonstrate a significant elevation of his hips and a large
54
coller.
separation of the legs.
f)	 Handstand elements must be achieved with completely straight
arms and without any interruption of swing or obvious use of
strength.
g)	In flair or circle to handstand dismounts and elements returning
to flairs or circles (or support), execution deductions for hesitation, strength, bent arms, lowering of the hips, and unsteadiness must be considered on the rise to the handstand, within
the pirouette, the lower from the handstand, and the extension
of the flairs or circles upon completion of the element. There is
no deduction for bending of the hips on the rise to handstand.
h)	A dismount must normally cross the body of the horse and land
in cross stand facing along the long axis of the horse while
landing adjacent to the last hand support position.
i)	 A simple handstand dismount must cross the horse in order to
be recognized. A handstand dismount does not have to cross
the horse provided that It includes a turn of at least 270º from
the side support or 360º from the cross support.
j)	 Expectations for scissor to handstand elements:
-	 The gymnast is expected to swing to handstand without
strength or hesitation, with hips stretched throughout.
-	 A scissor to handstand with pronounced hip bend and
strength should receive these two separate deductions
from the E jury.
-	 Scissors to handstands demonstrating swing with strength
and/or lowering of the hips or legs will be deducted by the
E jury.
-	 All scissors to handstand require the legs to close.
k)	Clarifications concerning evaluation for Li Ning Scissor to
handstand performed with hand(s) stepping errors:
-	 Step down off pommel with one hand with return to the
single pommel = D value (D jury) and -0.3 + other execution errors (E jury) for uncontrolled handstand support.
-	 Step down off pommel with one hand with no return to the
single pommel= D value (D jury) and -0.5 + other execution errors (E jury) for uncontrolled handstand support.
-	 Step down off pommel with two hands= no value (D jury)
and -0.5 or -1.0 (dependent on continuance of exercise
or fall) + other execution errors (E jury).
	 Note: All other scissors to handstand with support of both hands
on the leather = no value (D jury) and -0.5 or -1.0 (dependent
on continuance of exercise or fall) + other execution errors (E
jury).
E).
55
l) All dismounts other than handstand dismounts must be executed with the body at a minimum angle of 30º above the
shoulder horizontal line before landing. For angles lower than
30º, deductions will be applied according to the specific errors
and deductions table for pommel horse, Art. 11.3.
m) If a gymnast believes he did not receive value for his dismount,
he may repeat any dismount for value (one time only) within
30 seconds of completing the original attempt. If the original
dismount received a large deduction, and the dismount is
repeated, the large deduction must be increased to -1.0 by
the E jury.

a.3)	Unless otherwise indicated, each element is defined as
occurring within one structure and ending when a new
structure is initiated, as follows (Exception: the combined
i.	 A hop element ends at the completion of the hop or
series of hops.

vii.	Magyar & Sivado may share a common circle connecting them and receive D+D difficulty. To receive
credit for an A value circle between the two travels,
the A value circle must be completed fully from front
support to front support.
viii.	In the Code of Points Belenki, Urzica, and Moguilny

from a circle element) will be valued two letters lower than
the value from the listed element in the Code of Points.
a.7)	A Russian Wendeswing to a dismount beginning in cross
support facing out must complete Russian(s) as listed
before the Wende to receive full dismount value.
a.8)	A Wu Guonian requires a minimum 360° of body turn to be
completed with one or two hands between the pommels.
a.9)	Tong Fei elements can be performed with 4 different types
of start/end positions. Three of these types require a full
circle to be completed after the end position (side to cross,
cross to side, cross to cross) for value.
a.10) No partial value will be given to any travel element
with a fall. Example: Magyar travel with fall after the first
pommel while attempting to continue the travel action
will receive no value.
a.11) No additional elements may be added to increase the
value of these elements:

c)	Handstand
c.1) 	There is no upgrade in value for turning within a handstand from scissors.
c.2)	 There is no upgrade in value for the performance of turning within a handstand (from circles or flairs) solely on the
pommels. Turning within a handstand requires a majority
use of the leather.
c.3)	When performing a 3/3 travel during a handstand (within
an exercise or dismount), “support” with one hand must
be shown on both ends of the horse to receive the 3/3
upgrade in value.

c.5)	Swing with strength and/or lowering of the hips or legs
in achieving handstands from a scissor or from circles or
flairs (including dismounts) will receive the value for the
element and element group (D jury) with E-jury deductions. However, if there is a large error, no recognition will
be given for the handstand or dismount. In the case of a
large deduction, the gymnast will receive a -0.5 deduction
and only deductions for aesthetic errors (legs, feet, bent
arms, touch horse, etc.). No deductions for strength or
angle will be applied.
c.6)	All scissors through handstand on one pommel require
a change of arm or pommel to receive value.
d.1)	It is possible to combine certain elements on a single
pommel. There are two types of such combined elements
listed in the Element Group II:
i.	 Flop type elements may include combinations of any
of the following on one pommel: circle in side support
(with or without ¼ turn), circle in cross support (with
or without ¼ turn), Direct Stöckli B, and/or Direct
Stöckli A; and may include a maximum of two of the
elements (flops) can only be of D or E value (i.e. 3
or 4 elements). As an exception a D flop performed
in flair = E, and an E flop performed in flair = F. Only
one such flop sequence may be used in an exercise
59

1 flop

for value.
The following examples illustrate this rule:
•	Circle on one pommel + DSB + DSB + DSA = E
value flop
ii.	 Combined sequences on one pommel of circle and/
or Stöckli A or B with Russian wendeswings. The
circle and/or Stöckli B can either precede or follow
the Russian wendeswings and must appear as 2
consecutive circle elements to be part of a two-flop
Combined Sequence. The DSA may only appear at
the end of the sequence. Only one of these combined
sequences may be used during an exercise.

iii.	 In any case when a combined element is involved,
the gymnast will not have the right to make use of
the same element three times in direct succession.
iv.	 Flop and combined elements must be separated
by minimum one circle with one hand off of the one
pommel
v.	 A DSB is considered finished in side support frontways on one pommel.
d.2)	No other double elements will be credited for higher
value. For example: 2 circles or 2 DSB’s in any position
receive credit only for the first circle or DSB and no value
or recognition for the second.
e) Spindles
e.1)	Spindles in EG II in cross or side support with legs together or flair must be performed within a maximum 2
circles (3 front support positions after the original start
position) for D value.
e.2) There are two D value 1/1 Spindles (EG II) in the Code
of Points:
•	 Any cross support 1/1 spindle within max. 2 circles.
(also with 1/3, ½ or 2/3 travel) (Magyar)- Element II.34.

f.1)	 Pommel Horse is the only apparatus where a dismount
may be repeated (one time only) if the gymnast determines he may not have received credit because of a fall or
a large deduction. This must be done within the allowable
time. If the gymnasts steps off the podium (this includes
the stairs), the exercise is terminated.
f.2)	 In the case of a repeated dismount, the gymnast has 30
seconds to remount the horse and perform any type of
dismount of his choice for value and EG IV.

the rule are flop/ Russian combinations on one pommel, Kroll
(III.81), Roth (III.82), Wu Guonian (III.83), and Tong Fei type
elements (III.75, 76, 87, 89) elements.
c)	A maximum of 2 handstand elements are permitted for value
in an exercise from circles, flairs, or scissors (not including the

Section 12: Rings
Height: 280 cm from the floor.
An exercise on the Rings is composed of swing, strength and hold
parts in approximately equal portions. These parts and combinations
are executed in a hang position, to or through a support position,
or to or through the handstand position, and execution with straight
arms should be predominant. Contemporary gymnastic exercises are
characterized by transitions between elements of swing and strength
or the reverse. The swinging of the cables and the crossing of the
cables are not permitted.
Article 12.2 Content and Construction
Article 12.2.1 Information about Exercise Presentation
1.	From a still stand, the gymnast must jump or be assisted to a still
hang on the Rings with legs together, and with good form. The
evaluation begins with the first movement of the gymnast from the
moment he leaves the floor. The coach is not permitted to give the
gymnast an initial swing.
2.	The gymnast must include only elements that he can perform
with complete safety and a high degree of aesthetic and technical
mastery.
3.	All exercises should contain an approximately equal distribution
of swing, hold and strength elements. Consequently, an exercise
cannot include more than three elements from groups II and/or III
4.	Back swings in support that do not lead to at least a value part but
simply reverse direction and swing back down in or to a lower hang
position are deducted by the E-jury. A typical example of such a
layaway on rings is: from a kip to support, swing back to layaway
to front uprise.
5.	Additional Technical, aesthetic and execution aspects in the exercise construction expectations are:
a)	Hold positions must be reached directly, with straight arms,
and without need for positional or postural corrections.
b)	All hold positions must be held for a minimum of 2 seconds.
c)	Upward swings must lead to or through a handstand, or directly
to a strength hold element whenever the nature of the swing
d)	During all swing to strength hold elements, the shoulders
may not rise above the level of the final hold position. Any
deviation will result in the appropriate deductions by the E-
76
(2 s.).
IV.	Sorties.
jury and, depending on the nature of the element, may lead
to non-recognition by the D-jury.
e)	Swing elements that lead to strength hold elements which must
reverse direction (i.e. front uprise to Swallow; front uprise to
inverted cross and so on…) will be counted as two elements.
f)	 A false grip (over grip) for strength holds is not permitted. A
false grip is performed with the wrists bent in order to gain an
advantage in performing a strength element, deduction -0.1
each time.
	 No false grip: straight wrists with or without the fingers of the
hands wrapped around the Rings.
	 Note: The position of the rings in the hands (with straight wrists
and open hands) does not change the evaluation (no false
grip).
g)	Straight arms must be used whenever the nature of the element permits it.
h)	 Composition errors with deductions of -0,30 points. Example:
	 Honma to support then lift to L sit OR Straddle L sit to L sit
OR Kip to support then L sit, etc.
i)	 Only for strength elements to handstand with bent arms,
where the necessary technique requires minimal touching of
the straps with the lower arms, no deduction should be taken
for contact with the straps (Elements II.25 and II.26).
6.	Yamawaki/Jonasson elements showing a full support or pause
will receive a 0.5 deduction for swing with strength (receiving
non-recognition). These elements with less support shown will
be recognized with small and medium deductions for swing with
strength.
7.	Gymnasts demonstrating very little change in body position after
moving from one hold position to another are subject to execution
deductions and possible non-recognition (i.e: Swallow to support
scale and Hanging scale rearways to Swallow).
8.	For a full list of errors and deductions governing Exercise Presentation, see Section 9 and the summary of deductions in Articles 9.4
and 12.3.
Article 12.2.2 Information about the “D score”
1.	The Element Groups (EG) are:
I.	 Kip and swing elements & swings through or to handstand
(2 sec.).
II. 	 Strength elements and hold elements (2 sec.).
III. 	 Swing to Strength hold elements (2 sec.).
IV. 	Dismounts.
2.	Repeated elements (same Code Identification Number) cannot
contribute to the “D” score. On Rings, this rule is extended so that
not more than 3 elements from groups II and/or III can be presented
in direct succession. The 4th and subsequent Elements from Group
II and/or III of the same sequence will be considered as repetition,
and not recognized by the D jury. However if the gymnast decides
77
to execute more elements from Element Groups II and/or III, in
order to be recognized by the “D” Jury, he must perform at least a
B value swing element from elements Group I (except any kind of
kip/back kip, or element in the same Code box) between the first
sequence of maximum 3, and another element or sequence from
Element Groups II and/or III.
	 This swing element of at least a B value must have to be among
the 10 best or top 5 counting in an element group for recognition.
3.	Special repetitions:
a)	Repeated elements (same Code Identification Number) cannot
contribute to the “D” score. On Rings, this rule is extended so
that a maximum of 1 final strength position in each EG may be
recog­nized for difficulty. Thus, for example only two cross type
elements (regular, L cross, or V cross) or support scale type
elements (regular or straddled) are permitted in an exercise for
difficulty value (one in Group II and one in Group III).
b)	A maximum of 2 Guczoghy and a maximum of 2 Li Ning type
elements can be present in the exercise, the 3rd and subsequent
within either type of element will be considered as repetition.
4.	Additional information and regulations:
a)	All holds must be held for a minimum of 2 seconds. They will
be not recognized by the “D” Jury for Difficulty and/or Elements
Group requirements if no stop position is shown.
b)	Strength presses and lifts which follow a previous hold element
and end in a 2 second hold position are recognized only if the
preceding hold part has been recognized and if a stop position
is shown.
c)	Elements with crossing of the cables are not permitted, being
deducted as composition errors.
d)	For juniors, elements which include saltos backward in hang
and Li Ning type elements are not permitted.
e)	Pineda type elements must be executed with straight body,
straight arms, a momentary hold in the front lever and slowly
to avoid deduction or classification as a swing to strength
element.
f)	 Yamawaki/Jonasson elements showing a full support or pause
will not be recognized for difficulty. A Honma to support and
fwd. swing out to hang will not be recognized as separate
values because of the gymnast’s intent.
g)	All V hold positions (2 sec.) must be performed with legs vertical. This is the same as the requirement for Floor Exercise.
intenta.
h)	An exercise must start in a hang position with arms vertical
and straight. The gymnast may NOT bend their arms in moving to the first position unless specifically needed for element
completion. Example: Cast up and underswing backward may
78
be started with bent arms any time during an exercise.
i)	 During an exercise, a gymnast may only bend their arms during a transition between elements when necessary to properly
perform the next element.
j) For the hold of a non-listed part for 2 seconds or more, deduct
-0.1 each time. Some elements typically featuring this problem
(hold of 2 sec. or more) include: inverted hang, inverted pike,
and dorsal hang.
k)	Nakayama elements must pass through a complete hanging
scale rearways to prevent execution deductions and potential
non-recognition.
l) A dorsal hang to Cross or V Cross is not an acceptable entry
position to elevate the value for either cross (or any other
strength element). If either cross is performed directly from a
dorsal hang, each will retain its independent Code of Points
value (B and C respectively).
m) One Swing to handstand element (2 s. hold) is required in the
exercise and must be inside 10 counting elements.
5.	For a further list of regulations governing non-recognition of elements and other aspects of the “D score”, see Section 7 and the
summary of deductions in Article 7.6.

Section 13: Saut
Section 13: Vault
Height: 135 cm measured from the floor
Article 13.1 Description of a Vault Exercise
The gymnast must perform one vault except in Qualification for Vault
Finals and in Vault Finals where he must show two vaults from different Vault Groups and with different 2nd flight phases (for higher
difficulty vaults). For example: different direction - fwd./bwd and/or
different position - tucked/piked (for simple saltos) or minimum ½ turn
difference (for twisting saltos and simple flights). Each vault begins
with a run and a takeoff from both feet (with or without a round off) to
the vault board with legs together and is executed with a brief support
phase on the table with two hands. The vault may contain single or
multiple turns around the two axes of the body. After the first vault,
the gymnast returns without delay to the starting position and, at the
signal of the D1 Judge, performs his second vault.
Article 13.2 Content and construction
Article 13.2.1 Information about Exercise Presentation
1.	The gymnast must begin vault from a still stand with legs together
at a maximum distance or 25 meters, measured from the front edge
of the table to the inner side of the block attached at the end of the
vault run up mat. The vault begins with the first step or hop of the
gymnast, but the evaluation begins the moment his feet contact
the vaulting board. The length of the approach must be marked
on or alongside the approach lane.
2.	The vault ends with a landing behind the table in a standing position with legs together facing either towards or away from the table
(frontways or rearways).
3.	The gymnast must show only vaults that he can perform with
complete safety and with a high degree of aesthetic and technical
mastery. He is required to show the Identification Number of his
intended vault before he vaults.
4.	The gymnast may take-off only forwards or backwards and with
legs together. The only element that may be performed before the
vaulting board is a round off. For such vaults, the use of the vaulting board safety “collar” is mandatory and must be provided by
the competition organizer. For round-off entry vaults, the gymnast
may use one official handy-mat provided only by the organizer.
5.	Vaults with saltos during the first flight phase and vaults with
straddled legs are neither listed nor permitted.
6.	The gymnast must show the intended body position (tucked, piked,
or stretched) in a distinct and unmistakable manner. Indistinct body
positions are deducted by the E-Jury and may result in recognition
97
mains.
as a lower value vault by the D-Jury.
7.	Basis for the Evaluation by the E-Jury:
a)	First flight phase, up to the support with two hands.
b)	2nd flight phase, including the pushing off from the table up
to the landing in a standing position. The gymnast must demonstrate a distinct rise in the height of his body after push off
from the table.
c)	Body position in the momentary support on the table.
d)	Deductions with regard to the deviation from the extended axis
of the table.
e)	Technical execution during the entire vault.
f)	 The landing.
8.	Landing Rules:
a)	The gymnast must land with both feet within an area marked
left and right of the extended centre line of the table as described in the following draw.
aparato.


	 These lines must be clearly marked on the landing mat. Stepping on the line, but not over the line, is permitted.
	 The mat containing the marked landing zone for alignment
must be securely fastened so that it cannot shift during competition.
b)	Twisting during vaults must be completed before landing.
Incomplete twists result in the appropriate deduction, and if
incomplete by 90° or more, will result in non-recognition by
the D-jury and in recognition as a vault with a lower Difficulty
Value.
9.	In the 2nd flight phase, the gymnast must show a conspicuous rise
in height of his center of gravity at the moment of hand push-off.
10. Salto vaults tucked or piked must display a distinct opening phase
in preparation for landing. A landing that is not prepared is a sign of
an error in technique and will usually result in a technical execution
deduction as well as a landing deduction.
11. For a full list of errors and deductions governing Exercise Presentation see, Section 9 and the summary of deductions in Articles
9.4 and 13.3.
Article 13.2.2 Information about the D score
1.	The gymnast must show one vault in Qualification, Team Final
and the All-Around Final. In the Qualification for Vault Final and in
Vault Finals he must show two vaults, which must be from different

2.	Each vault is listed, numbered, and given a value in the Difficulty
Tables within its Group. The following general principles apply:
Palomas.
a)	Cuervo vaults have the same value as equivalent Handspring
Salto vaults with twists.
b)	Kasamatsu vaults have the same value as the equivalent
c)	Yurchenko vaults have the same value as the analogous
d)	Unless otherwise indicated, round-off entry vaults with ½ turn
to the table have a value of 0.20 more than the analogous
e)	Unless otherwise indicated, round-off entry vaults with ¾ or 1/1
turn to the table have a value of 0.60 more than the analogous
3.	Each vault is given a unique Difficulty Value based on its complexity.
4.	Prior to the execution of each vault, the appropriate vault number,
as assigned in the Code of Points must be displayed for the D-jury.
This function is performed by the gymnast, or an assistant, with
the aid of a flashboard and is not penalized in the case of error.
Example: #319 - The #3 designates the vault group; the
#19 designates the vault number within that vault group.
5.	The gymnast must show the intended body position (tucked, piked,
or stretched) in a distinct and unmistakable manner. Non-distinct
body positions may result in non-recognition by the D-Jury or
recognition as a vault with a lower Difficulty Value. (see the body
position definitions in Appendix A Section 3). The gymnast must
display the vault number for the vault that he can do, not the one
he hopes to do. This warning applies especially for the recognition
of stretched and piked positions.
6.	The placement mat may be used for roundoff entry vaults only,
and is optional.
7.	The vault is invalid (0.00 point from the D-Jury and the E-Jury)) when:
a)	The vault is executed without a support phase, i.e., neither
hand touches the table.
b)	Failure to use the safety collar for round-off entry vaults.
c)	The vault is so poorly executed that the intended vault cannot
be recognized, or the gymnast pushes from the table with his/
her feet.
d)	Spotting assistance during the vault.
e)	The gymnast does not land with his feet first. This means that
at least one foot must contact the landing mat before any other
part of the body.
99
f)	 The gymnast lands intentionally in a side stand.
g)	The gymnast performs a prohibited vault (straddled legs, salto
in first flight, prohibited pre-element before the vaulting board,
etc.).
h) The first vault is repeated for the second vault in Qualification
for Vault Final or in Vault Final.
A video review by D- panel and Apparatus supervisor will automatically occur for every vault receiving an Invalid “0 “Score.
All E-Jury judges enter their deductions after every vault performed. The D jury will notify them in the case of a “0” vault and
advise them of the method to present a “0” E-score.
7.	In Qualification, Team Final, and All-Around Final:
	 • One vault must be performed.
	 • In Qualification, the 1st vault score counts toward the Team and/
	 For Qualification and in the Apparatus Final, each gymnast must
perform two different vaults which must be from different Vault Groups
(for pages 1 & 2 of Vault Value Table) and which may not have the same
or similar 2nd flight phases (for page 2 of the Vault Value Table only).
	 In Qualification and in the Apparatus Final, the average score
of the 2 vaults will determine the final score for the gymnast.
8.	Additional run approaches are permitted as follows, with deduction
of 1.00 for empty run (if gymnasts has not touched the springboard
or apparatus).
-	 When 1 vault is required, a second run approach is permitted
with deduction. Third approach not permitted.

Section 14: Parallel Bars
Height: 180 cm from top of mat, 200 cm from floor.
A contemporary parallel bar exercise consists predominantly of swing
and flight elements selected from all available Element Groups and
performed with continuous transitions through various hang and
support positions in such a way as to reflect the full potential of the
apparatus.
Article 14.2 Content and Construction
Article 14.2.1 Information about Exercise Presentation
1. The gymnast must initiate his Parallel Bar mount or his run-up
from a still stand with legs together. The exercise begins the moment the feet leave the ground. Swinging with one leg or stepping
into the mount is not permitted. The feet must leave the ground
simultaneously.
2.	A vaulting board placed at the height of the regulation landing mats
is permitted for the mount.
3.	Pre-elements are not permitted. This means that any element that
rotates more than 180º around any body axis may not be performed
prior to grasping the rail or rails with the hands.
4. The gymnast must include only elements that he can perform
with complete safety and a high degree of aesthetic and technical mastery.
5. Additional execution and exercise construction expectations are:
a)	Back swings in support or upper arm hang that do not lead to at
least a value part but simply reverse direction and swing back
down in or to a lower hang or support position are deducted,
i.e:
•	 Back swing in upper arm hang, layaway to glide kip.
•	 Back swing in support, layaway to front uprise.
•	 Back swing in support, layaway to hang.
•	 Glide kip to upper arm hang or to momentary support and
lay back to upper arm hang.
•	 From handstand, lower to shoulder roll forward.
b)	No extra support is allowed during elements with turns on
one arm support. Elements such as giant swing with turn,
backward uprise with turn, forward uprise with full turn, Felge
113
horizontal.
IV.	Sorties.
elements with turn, etc. will be considered finished where the
c)	All elements in hang followed by kips must be executed with
d)	The following elements or groups of elements are not permitted:
•	 Strength and hold elements that are not listed in the difficulty tables.
•	 Saltos and dismounts from side hang on one bar.
•	 Saltos with reception in upper arms and/or bent arms
support for juniors.
e)	Elements performed to one bar (Chiarlo, Piasecky, etc..) must
be executed to a handstand with hands slightly apart. A slight
deviation of the shoulders/body is permitted because of the
unnatural hand position. Deductions will be taken for excessive
hand separation and/or body deviation.
f)	 On all Moy and Giant Bwd. swings, legs may not bend until
body is horizontal.
g)	The deduction for lack of extension before regrasping after
saltos means the extension (opening) should be at horizontal
(bar height).
6. For a full list of errors and deductions governing Exercise Presentation, see Section 8 and the summary of deductions in Article 14.3.
Article 14.2.2 Information about the “D score”
1.	The Element Groups (EG) are:
I.	 Elements in support or through support on 2 bars.
II. 	Elements starting in upper arm position.
III. 	Long swings in hang on 1 or 2 bars and underswings.
IV. 	Dismounts.
2. Information on difficulty value:
a)	For elements which include turns, the turns are not recognized
as part of the element if the turn happens after the handstand
position or after a hop to handstand. Examples: basket with
inlocation and hop to handstand with turn or giant swing half
turn with hop to handstand followed by turns.
b)	Unless otherwise indicated, elements that deliberately re-grasp
in bent arm support are considered to have the same identification number and value as elements which re-grasp in upper
arm support. However, elements that are initiated from bent
arm support are considered to have the same identification
number and value as elements from or through support.
c)	Unless otherwise indicated in the difficulty tables, elements
performed from or to unusual or rotated grip positions (supinated or pronated) have the same identification number and
value as analogous elements performed from or to the usual
grip position.
114
d)	Elements formed by combined independent elements must
demonstrate no pause between elements, or they will receive
their independent values.
e)	In the Qualifications or Team Finals, for preparation of the
Parallel Bars prior to an exercise (during the one-touch warmup and competition), any FOP accredited person from the
federation of the gymnasts may assist. In the All-Around or
Apparatus Finals, a maximum of three people (the competing
gymnast, coach, and 1 other FOP accredited person may be
on the podium to prepare the bars.
3.	Additional information and regulations:
a)	Many swinging elements lead to or are defined to a handstand
on one or two rails. The handstands from swing need not be
held but the element must be performed in a manner that
convincingly demonstrates that the handstand position could
have been held if so desired.
b)	Special rule: Elements to one bar in cross support have the
same value as done to two bars, except they increase by one
value more when connected to Healy type elements (each
Healy element also increases by one value)- hold is allowed
in the one bar handstand.
c)	 Elements to one bar upgrade the value if is connected to healy
type elements, but only if the healy element is executed without
d)	No straddle element to one bar can receive an increase in
e)	How to evaluate Makuts type elements with a pause or stop
during the first part of the element:

-0.5 for Pausing or

	 For example: Makuts to handstand with less than a one second
hold after the ¾ Diamidov and then ¾ Healy = E value and
-0.1 for Pausing or Stopping in handstand.
f)	 All Healys must have 360° or more turns to be recognized as
a Healy type element.
	 i.e. From a swing element (minimum B value) to handstand
on one bar sideways, requires a Healy (450° turn) to support
115
	Exemples:
for an E value.
	 Note: A ¾ Healy, from sideways position, is a B value and
same box as Element I.44.
4.	Special repetitions:
a)	Elements with saltos: an exercise can not include more than
one variation of the same element (within the same EG). In
this case the element with the highest difficulty value will be
counted for difficulty.
- 	Morisue tuck or Morisue pike.
- 	5/4 Salto fwd straddled to up. arm hang or to bent arm
support or through support to hang/directly to hang.
b)	Maximum two Giant Swings to handstand (III. 21, 22, 28, 29
& 35).
c)	 Maximum two Basket Swings to handstand (III. 106, 107, 114,
119, 120, 130,136).

Section 15: Horizontal Bar
Height: 260 cm from top of mat, 280 cm from the floor.
A contemporary Horizontal Bar Exercise must be a dynamic
presentation that consists entirely of the fluid connection of swinging,
turning, and flight elements alternating between elements performed
near to and far from the bar in a variety of hand grips so as to
demonstrate the full potential of the apparatus.
Article 15.2 Content and Construction
Article 15.2.1 Information about Exercise Presentation
1.	The gymnast must jump or be assisted to a still or swinging hang
on the Horizontal Bar from a still stand with legs together or from a
short run, but always with good form. The evaluation begins from
the moment the gymnast leaves the floor.
2.	The gymnast must include only elements that he can perform
with complete safety and a high degree of aesthetic and technical
mastery.
3.	Other execution and exercise construction expectations are:
a)	The exercise must consist entirely of swings without stops or pauses.
b)	Deviations in swings to or through handstand, including turns.

Turning Elements finishing in mixed elgrip and double elgrip are
subject to the following deductions:
= 	 - 0.5 and non-recognition (by the D jury)

and non - recognition
c)	Flight elements must demonstrate a conspicuous rise of the
body during the flight phase.
d)	Backward swings to handstand that simply reverse direction
and swing back down in the reverse direction are deducted
(composition errors) each time with 0,30 points.
	 Specific examples of such layaways are:
•	 Following a kip cast or back uprise to handstand - layaway
to giant swing bwd., Stalder, free hip, ½ turn to el-grip, etc.
•	Following a backward uprise to handstand and hop to
overgrip - swing forward to giant swing bwd., Stalder, free
(Also other angle deductions also need to be applied for
missing the handstand position).
e)	Any flight element with salto over the bar requires a giant swing
afterward or -0.3 (E-jury deduction).
f) For all Adler elements it is not required to enter from a handstand position.
4.	For a full list of errors and deductions governing Exercise Presentation, see Section 9 and the summary of deductions in Articles 9.4
and 15.3.
etc.

3.	Additional information and regulations:
a)	Unless otherwise indicated, the value and identification numbers of elements listed in the Difficulty Tables are the same if
performed from handstand, from a back swing, or from some
other position.
b)	Unless otherwise indicated, elements have the same difficulty
value and identification number when performed with the
“wrong grip” or atypical grip positions.
c)	Elements that end in a double elgrip have one letter superior
value than the same elements ending in one arm elgrip.
d)	Unless listed in the Difficulty Tables, elements with or from feet
on the bar are not permitted (exception: Piatti elements).
e)	Starting or re-grasping flight elements with one hand (or “wrong
grip”) has the same value and identification number as starting
or re-grasping with two hands.
f)	 Elements with turns must show the turns as an integral part
of the element being performed and the turn must be initiated
on the way up (exception Endo type elements).
g)	Elements with hops to handstand, which include turns, must
initiate the turn during the hop and must re-grasp with the
second hand only after the turn has been completed. A regrasp may occur initially with one hand and then the second
hand as the turn is completed. A hop element is considered
finished at the moment that both hands re-grasp the bar.
h)	El-grip elements meet only the requirements for the Element
Group in which they are listed.
I.	 Flight elements from el-grip are considered to belong to
Element Group II.
II.	 Dismounts from el-grip are considered to belong to Element Group IV.
III.	Endo swings in el-grip are considered to belong to Element Group III.
i)	 Expectation for Rybalko:
•	 Prerequisite condition for Rybalko is both hands in el-grip
in end position.

136
Exemples:
•	 Visible hop and fluid turn, not the turn on supporting arm.
j)	 Turning elements in one hand support position must be considered as finished at the moment the gymnast re-grasps the
bar with the second hand.
k)	Unless otherwise indicated, an element composed of two
separate elements will result in divided values when a grip
change occurs. (i.e. Endo in overgrip, change one hand to
undergrip, and 1/1 turn to el-grip = B+C).
la barra.
4.	Unless otherwise indicated, for elements of Group I and III, the
following principles are used for the determination of difficulty:
a)	Value of the base element has been given a certain value.
•	A ½ turn does not increase the difficulty.
•	A 1/1 turn increases the difficulty by one letter.
•	A1/1 turn or greater to both el-grip increases the difficulty
by two letters.
•	A hop does not increase the difficulty.
•	Re-grasp in double el-grip increases the difficulty by one
letter.
b)	The element has the same value and identification number
whether it crosses the bar or not, as long as the amplitude
stipulations have been met.
5.	Flight elements from el-grip and dismounts from el-grip or dorsal
hang have the same value as elements performed in regular grip.
dificultad.
normal.
Ejemplos:
6.	Special repetitions:
a)	A maximum of two Stoop Circle Rearward forward through
handstand elements (Adler type) are permitted. In this case
the elements with the highest difficulty value will be counted.
b)	Elements with turns: an exercise cannot include more than
one grip variation of the same element. The second executed
one in chronological order is considered as repetition.
Examples:
•	 If a Rybalko in double el grip is executed, another Rybalko
in mixed grip or one hand grip is not permitted.
•	 If an Endo with 1/1 turn in mixed grip is executed, another
Endo with 1/1 turn in double el grip is not permitted.
•	 If a Stalder ½ turn in double el grip is executed, another
Stalder ½ turn in mixed grip is not permitted.
7.	Regrasping Tkatchev ½ or Yamawaki ½ elements without sufficient
turning and continuing to handstand (or directly connecting to a
release element) will receive the value for the identical element
listed in the code of points without a ½.
8.	For an el-grip or Russian giant to be recognized directly after an
Adler or turn to el-grip, the el-grip or Russian giant requires a swing
over the bar in el-grip in order to receive a value.
9.	A Zou Li Min executed with insufficient turning (greater than 90°
deviation on first full twist) will not be recognized by the D-jury
and receive a -0.5 deduction by the E-jury. This element may not
be devalued to a Giant Swing Fwd. with one arm in undergrip (B
value).
137
grand tour dorsal avant (grand tour russe, Élément IV.15) doivent
en prise cubitale.
11. The Yamawaki element must be stretched when passing through
a vertical body position over the bar for no deductions. An excessive pike or a poor vertical position over the bar will be deducted
and could also lead to recognition of a B value flight element.
12. Yamawaki ½ will need to have all turning continue in the same
direction for the increase in letter value. If the element turns in two
different directions, the element will not be recognized by the D
jury. This element has the same twisting specification as all other
elements in the Code of Points.
13. Flight elements always receive value when two hands regrasp
the bar and a distinct hang phase is shown before the gymnast
falls. If the catch is performed with one arm, the value is given to
the gymnast when two hands have finally regrasped the bar or
another element has been clearly initiated.
14. A Rybalko to one arm with additional ½ or 1/1 turn. Numerous
variations of these elements have been proposed. The MTC will
not permit any additional turning in order to raise the value of
any Code of Points listed elements performed on one arm for the
safety of all gymnasts.
15. Giant swing bwd. with hop 3/2 t. to one arm giant swing (Rybalko
to one arm giant swing) is the same value and box as Rybalko to
undergrip or mixed el-grip (Element I.63).
	 Note: This rule also applies to all Stalder Rybalko type elements.
16. One arm giant swing fwd. w. 1/1 t. to el-grip and 1/1 t. to ugr. (Zou
Li Min, Element I.27) cannot be combined with any other element
for an increase in value.
17. Endo in el-grip thr. hdst. (Element IV.39): As long as the hands are
in el-grip during the entry of the legs, a hop out to undergrip, mixed
grip, or overgrip afterward is permitted without a loss of value.
18. How to determine evaluate el-grip combinations:
	 An El-grip giant swing (Element IV.14) and Giant swing rearways
fwd. (Russian giant, Element IV.15) only require going over the top
of the bar in el-grip to receive their listed value. No specific amount
of a giant swing in el-grip is required in order for the element to be
recognized.
	 Sequence examples:
1. Adler to 50° from handstand, swing in-elgrip through the bottom
and over the top, swing in elgrip through the bottom and hop
out to undergrip= No value for Adler (and -0.5 angle deduction)
and B value el-grip giant.
138
2. Adler to handstand, swing in el-grip through the bottom and over
the top into el-grip Endo, swing through the bottom in el-grip
Endo, and hop out to undergrip = C value Adler, B value el-grip
19. Flights elements with ½ turns to mixed el-grip must have more
than 50% of the turn completed upon catching the bar in order to
receive no deduction while continuing to back uprise to handstand.
E-jury deductions of small, medium, large should be applied for
any insufficient turning upon catching the bar.
20. Stoop circle fwd. to straddle cut to hang or sup. (Element II.1)Gymnast may enter at any angle from a giant swing or swing
forward.

Appendix A
Additional Explanations & Interpretations
1.	The text in the difficulty tables supersedes the illustrations.
2.	(See Art. 7.4.m) This rule is interpreted, in part, as follows:
a)	Twisting elements on all six apparatus will not be recognized
if they are performed with a 1/4 twist (90°) short of or beyond
the specifications for the intended element
b)	Swinging elements on all appropriate apparatus will not be
recognized if they are completed 45° or greater from the perfect or the prescribed end position. On the Horizontal Bar this
means, for example, that a free hip circle can be performed
up to 45° past a handstand and still be recognized by the DJury. On the Parallel Bars, for example, a Stützkehre must be
performed to at least 45° above horizontal to be recognized by
the D-Jury. A stretched position is considered piked if at any
time during the element a pike of greater than 45° is shown.
3.	 (See Section 9.1.1) Being performed with perfection implies also
that elements be performed with the specified body position. The
following definitions will apply.
a)	A perfect stretched body position is one in which a line from
the shoulders through the hips to the ankles is straight for
static elements and straight or slightly bent forwards or backwards during dynamic elements. If the hip assumes a flexion
of greater than 45° at any time during the element, it will be
considered piked.
b)	A perfect piked body position is one in which the knees are
straight and the hips are bent at least 90°. Errors include a
pike of less than 90° from the extended position and/or an
additional bending of the knees. If the knees assume a flexion
of greater than 45° at any time during the element, it will be
considered tucked.
c)	A perfect tuck position is one during which the hips are strongly
bent and the bent knees are brought to the chest - a minimum
90° bend in each. Errors include a hip bend of less than 90°
from the extended position and/or a knee bend of less than
d)	A stretched position with a knee flexion of 90° is considered
to be stretched but with a large error. If this occurs during an
element it will not be recognized by the D-jury.
e)	A straddled position must be shown with the maximum separation of the legs that the aesthetic and technical nature of the
element allows.
157
f)	 Each of the salto positions - tucked, piked, stretched, straddled
- is expected to be demonstrated so distinctly and conspicuously as to leave no doubt about the intent.
g)	A regular handstand on all apparatus is one with the body
perfectly aligned and without arch. A wide arm handstand on
Floor Exercise requires the head to be within one hand width
of the floor.
h)	Strength holds on all affected apparatus require, depending
on the element, the arms to be perfectly horizontal, and/or the
body to be perfectly horizontal, and/or the legs to be perfectly
horizontal.
i)	Certain dynamic elements when poorly performed can be
confused with other elements. Some typical examples include:
i.	 Twisting elements on all apparatus that over- or under-turn
by more than 90º.
ii.	 On Pommel Horse; cross support travels which are
oblique by more than 45º versus travels in side support.
iii.	 On Vault; handspring forward with salto (Group I) versus
¼ turn in preflight and ¼ turn off with salto forward (Group
II).
	In all such cases, the gymnast is obligated to demonstrate
the element he wishes to show in a distinct and unmistakable
manner. Failure to do so will always result in a large deduction
from the E-jury and non-recognition by the D-jury (or on Vault,
recognition as the element and Group with the lower value).
j)	 Exceptions can be made if the correct technical execution of
an element requires a modification of these definitions.
4.	 (See Section 9.1.4) This, along with Article 5.2.b is a most important directive for all judges especially with the stated expectation
that all elements be performed to perfect end positions. The judge
must at all times use his gymnastics knowledge and gymnastics
sense. The following examples may be instructive.
a)	It is possible to perform elements such as a Tkatchev to a
handstand on Horizontal Bar but it is not yet a reasonable, nor
perhaps a desirable, expectation. It is reasonable, however,
to expect in all cases that the element be performed with
technique of such excellence that the gymnast has had time
to prepare for the re-grasp, that it occur with straight arms,
and that it permit continuation with a smooth full swing.
b)	It is possible to perform a dislocate to handstand from inverted
hang on Rings, but it would certainly be an exception. The
deduction for not completing this element in handstand would
not apply.
c)	Some elements have a special purpose or effect and if such
purpose is conspicuous and aesthetic it would be exempt from
the usual amplitude requirements.
d)	It is possible to perform a reverse Stützkehre on Parallel Bars
through a handstand but that is essentially a different element
158

(it is listed as such in the Difficulty Tables) and should not
become the regular expectation for a reverse Stützkehre.
e)	There exist a small number of elements (bent arm vs. straight
arm press on several apparatus; amplitude on scales on Floor
Exercise; V-sits vs. high V-sits (Manna) on several apparatus;
planche vs. swallow on Rings) where intermediate positions
make recognition for the D-jury and evaluation difficult for
the E-Jury. The gymnast is expected to show his intended
position or performance so distinctly and conspicuously as to
leave no doubt about the intent. Intermediate or non-distinct
positions are always deducted by the E-Jury and may lead to
non-recognition by the D-jury.
